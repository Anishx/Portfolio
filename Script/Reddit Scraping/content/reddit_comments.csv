Also, Israel has one of the most advanced weapons manufacturing industries on the planet. They create 40% of the world’s drones and are responsible for 10% of weapon exports worldwide. They have developed their own fighter jets, missiles, arms, nuclear weapons, and defense systems. Their ability to cause harm if they wish is not dependent on US aid or sales. If you take it away from them, they can still inflict damage. Only now you have absolutely no say in the war efforts, whereas now we can still influence them as needed because they want those weapons and they want US protection from Iran.

Use this letter template:

Dear \[Representative's Full Name\],

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is \[Your Name\], and I am a concerned resident of \[Your City/State\]. I am writing to you today to express my strong support for a crucial piece of legislation introduced by Senator Jeff Merkley from Oregon.

The bill is titled ""S.3402 - A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose an excise tax on the failure of certain hedge funds owning excess single-family residences to dispose of such residences, and for other purposes."" I believe this legislation is vital for addressing issues related to housing affordability and promoting responsible ownership in our community.

As a resident of your district, I am acutely aware of the challenges many individuals and families face in securing affordable housing. Senator Merkley's proposed bill represents a significant step toward addressing these concerns by holding hedge funds accountable for their role in the housing market.

I kindly urge you to support and advocate for the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives. By doing so, you will contribute to fostering a fair and equitable housing market, ensuring that our community members have access to the affordable housing they deserve.

Thank you for your time and dedication to representing the interests of our community. I trust that you will carefully consider this request and take a stand in favor of the much-needed reforms outlined in Senator Merkley's bill.

Sincerely,

\[Your Full Name\]",0.98

Page 2: 'Taxpayers' are exempt from a $20,000 tax on homes over 100, if they sell 10% of the homes they own by the end of the year. 

Does this not mean they can own 10,000 homes, and if they flip 1000 by the end of the year, they don't pay the $20K tax, can buy another 10,000 at the beginning of the next, and then sell 1900 by the end of the next year, and avoid the tax again, and repeat ad infinitum? 

**Exclusions, page 3:** 

**‘‘(A) a mortgage note holder that owns a single-family residence through foreclosure ,**  
‘‘(B) a organization which is described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a),  
**‘‘(C) any person primarily engaged in the construction or rehabilitation of single-family residences, or**  
**‘‘(D) any person who owns federally subsidized housing.**

One inspector I worked with to test the software had been assigned a batch of thirty houses in the same mid-sized neighborhood. The bulk of the neighborhood had become rental properties or kept vacant by the company.  


It really gave me some horrible insight into how much of the available housing is snapped up by investors and investment groups like them, with no interest in anything but recouping the cost at minimum or making a huge cashout when they re-sold the property.

This sounds like a pipe dream idea of some fringe elements of the Democratic Party.  Like Green New
deal but way too big and easy to scare people.

I see two levers GOP will pull here

1.  It will wreck the rental market like it’s a bad thing.  
2.  It will crash the housing market. Prices drop 20%.  Seniors downsizing just lost a big piece of their nest egg.  Well to do suburbanites lose a chunk of their retirement plan. 

My HOA in my well to do neighborhood in a blue part of a red state that is almost purple is trying to do this on its own.  The apathy is immense.  This doesn’t win back the House.",0.98
New Legislation Proposes to Take Wall Street Out of the Housing Market,"This won't fix anything. The issue is new housing is constrained by restrictive zoning laws that don't let anyone build more. Wall street benefits because a product that people NEED TO LIVE will always go up in price if demand rises (more people) and supply cannot rise to meet it. If wall st is out of the picture, other landlords will come in and benefit instead. Hoards of NIMBY boomers and landlords will vote against zoning reform and the problem will continue.",0.98

>When Trump engages in the conspiracy-theory politics of destroying “the deep state”, what he really means is that he will rule by presidential decree and where possible undermine independent federal institutions, thus destroying the checks and balances that have for two and a half centuries been at the heart of the American constitution. No longer would we be able to say that the rule of law and democracy prevails in America, ***that voting is free of interference or intimidation***, or that power is properly accountable. He would kill for good any ideal of the “city on the hill”, and the liberal rules-based order with the US as the model for the world to emulate.

>Trump has already given us a preview of what awaits in this term, or what he calls his “final battle” for an “independent America”. This time around, Extreme-right thinktanks such as the Heritage Foundation are giving him detailed policy playbooks, like one titled ***Project 2025***, which recommends radically reshaping government departments and consolidating power in the executive branch, that he could implement from day one.

>Trump has been upping the rhetoric of vengeance for some time. As he declared at a recent rally:

Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,">  “The state says that Ms Cox has no injury, the harms to her health are not imminent but are ‘purely hypothetical’ and her legal claims are not yet ripe. These arguments are frankly stunning. The state goes as far to characterize her claims as ‘a frivolous assertion of harm’,” she said. Duane said the state’s argument amounted to a patient having to be about to die before they can have an abortion.

>   Jonathan Stone, the lawyer representing Texas, said: “The only party that’s going to suffer an immediate and irreparable harm in this case if the court enters a [temporary restraining order] is the state.” He claimed this was because Texas would not get to make its legal arguments in a regular hearing.

They tried to say the state of Texas is the victim here!  I am disgusted but not surprised.",0.98
Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,">Duane said in a statement after the hearing: “Today’s decision underscores what we already know – abortion is essential healthcare. While we are grateful that Kate will be able to get this urgent medical care, it is unforgivable that she was forced to go to court to ask for it in the middle of a medical emergency.

>“Most women are not able to do what Kate has done – many Texans have been forced to continue pregnancies that put their lives at risk. That is happening every day across Texas. As long as abortion is banned, pregnant people will suffer. As we await the Texas supreme court’s ruling in Zurawski v State of Texas, our hearts go out to the countless people in similar situations who – for so many reasons – aren’t able to sue the state of Texas for an emergency hearing.”

Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,"Fuck Texas. Fuck the idiots who voted for this horror show.   


I went through this hell. A completely non viable pregnancy where five different doctors told me there was no chance and yet every damned one of them told me to wait around for the inevitable miscarriage. Because that was less traumatic for THEM than terminating a non viable pregnancy. Because they didn’t want to be the OBs who were known “for doing that”. 

They made me carry around a huge paper medical file everywhere I went, because I would surely miscarry at any time, and I was instructed to go to the nearest ER immediately when that started happening and give them the file. Because otherwise I might die or never be able to give birth again. 

And I was stupid and did what they said, living in agony every day over this and guess what? My body wasn’t doing what these doctors wanted it do to do absolve them of guilt.And I got mad. Furious. I demanded they treat the live patient in front of them rather than the malformed entity that was living off my body, would never be a child and might kill me, before it was too late.   


They said  “just go to planned parenthood. They do all the abortions in town.” I said “ You told me I needed to know if this was a congenital problem and learn if all my pregnancies would end up this way. Can they do genetic testing?” The answer was no, but they did not care. I got beyond furious. Frantic referrals, to another state and in DC, before we found a doctor who would help me.   


I was long married. This was a planned and wanted child. I went through unbelievable  trauma. I will always remain deeply grateful to the doctor who finally helped me. I went on to have two healthy children because of that doctor. They are both young adults.

I will never forget. Never. I was pro choice before. Don’t fuck with me now.  I marched in my first pro choice rally with my infant daughter on my back. I will  vote until the day I die for every woman to have the choice.",0.98

"Ron DeSantis' ""snake"" appearance during Republican debate goes viral","By Giulia Carbonaro

Ron DeSantis' tongue got a lot of attention on social media during the fourth Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, with users ridiculing the Florida governor for what they called his ""snake"" move.

DeSantis, who in Republican primary polling is at 12.7 percent of the vote, just a couple of percentage points ahead of former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has a habit of licking his lips during media appearances—something his critics have been quick to notice and mock.

U.S. Officials Privately Raise Fears Of Israel-Gaza Conflict Sparking A Broader War,">Despite repeated calls for Israeli restraint from senior figures in the Biden administration, U.S. intelligence assesses the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are committed to “business as usual,” with only limited concern about civilian casualties, a U.S. official said, and there are suspicions the renewed campaign is actually bloodier than the previous offensive in northern Gaza.

What do the ""calls of restraint"" from the Biden administration accomplish as long as they [keep providing Israel with weapons to bomb Palestinians?](https://theintercept.com/2023/11/25/biden-israel-weapons-stockpile-arms-gaza/)

>A third State Department official voiced frustration with recent news articles suggesting the U.S. is encouraging Israeli caution and similar public statements, arguing: “It just feels like patting ourselves on the back while it increasingly seems like the IDF are waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”

Way worse was that that he accused the judge of just making it up.

> The judge challenged this, commenting; ""Where's all that coming from? Webster's Third International Dictionary defines it as an act or instance of revolting against civil authority or against an established government.

Federal law defines insurrection as:

INCITING (“Be there, will be wild”),

ENGAGING in (Trump said “fight” more than 20 times on January 6 and then told his armed followers to march to the Capitol) 

18 U.S.C. 2383

We have officially reached ludicrous speed where we’re debating whether Trump incited violence.  He does it every day.  He has a gag order against him because he cannot stop attacking people.  

That his followers smiled and clapped to Trump‘s response at the town hall interview, to the question about being a dictator, when he answered Day 1, is surreal.  It tells us everything we need to know, both about his followers, and what he would do if he ever gets near the oval office again.

But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors.

NEVER FORGET: Wikileaks is based in Russia, with the help of Russia, at the direction of Russia when deciding what to ""leak"" and only ever benefits Russia.

Assange is a republican in all but name. He breaks major laws and when a criminal charge is brought up to prosecute him, it's everybody else in the world's fault, he's an innocent angel, and he doubles and triples down on claiming it's all politically motivated false accusations (when we have the actual laws, and the facts, to show yes, he intentionally broke the law). Meanwhile he was literally hiding from Sweden when they acceused him of 3 counts of sexual assault in an embassy in Ecuador for 3+years. Very GOP-like, I'd say. The whole BS claim that Sweden made up those just to get him so they can extradite him to the US? Hell, Sweden isn't that good a friend of the US.

No actual examples will be given, of course. And how loud they'll say that last part depends on the conservative and who they think is listening. Oh, and there's also about a 30% chance they'll quote MLK out of context as if he would have absolutely loved what they're saying.",0.94

The cops who didn't like him kept telling him to not look at him....well...my cousin kept looking at him....so they proceeded to taze him 12 more times, hogtied on the ground and not fighting with 3 civilian witnesses. 

He died in the ambulance to what would be called excited delirium. The cops involved never had a single day of even paid suspension and when it reached the grand jury they didn't call a single one of the civilian witnesses while the official report says he was only tased twice.

Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,These articles *are* a joke. He's made it clear several times he has no interest in running for president.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"TL;DR - It's a joke. Or, at least, a pointless hypothetical by an out of touch moron (the author, not Stewart) who ignores that Stewart has enthusiastically refused to seek political office and anyone who had ever watched or listened to him would know that.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Yes, yes it is. 

I think the world of Jon Stewart, but if someone hasn't started building a campaign infrastructure by now, they're not going to be able to spin one up and mount a serious challenge to Trump in 11 months. Biden is going to be the nominee. He's the only serious Democratic candidate.

Plus, and this may be crazy talk, but the person with the best chance to beat Trump is probably the guy who last beat Trump.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"It's too late! 

Ballot access in Nevada closed in October, there's about another dozen states that closed ballot access since then, and another dozen that close in the next week.

No. Change the ridiculous voting system so that I can vote for Jon Stewart, but if he doesn't get enough votes then my vote instantly transfers to Elizabeth Warren, and if she doesn't get enough votes, then sure, Biden.

>That concept is horrifying, given that it could plausibly mean the collapse of U.S. democracy. The paradox of our current plight is that the people screeching most loudly — the corporate Democratic establishment — have demonstrated by their immovable support for Biden that they do not actually take this threat seriously. As Cohen puts it, they’d “rather lose with Biden, someone they can control and someone they’ve known and used for 30 years, than win with someone they can’t.” 

Took awhile to get there but the article did go there. 

If someone like Stewart ran it would be after Biden or if something came up in the next 11 months. The Democrat Party will not allow another Democrat to win after they have already chosen someone.",0.39

Key takeaways are that 11.5% of all US adults are smokers and 11.7% of black US adults are smokers so using this article’s claim of 80%+ of black smokers smoke menthols you’re looking at 9.5%-ish of black adults. 

Some other interesting info imo:the lower the household income, the higher the rate of smoking was (maxing out at 18.3%) and the Midwest was the area where people smoked the most at 14% followed by the South at 12.4%, Northeast at 10.4% and out west 8.9%.

That means 90% of bombs dropped killed were infinitely more likely to create an orphan than stop a terrorist. who do you think raised those orphans?

Now, the fake electors themselves have effectively admitted that the whole thing was a sham.

we were not the duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020

It would be easy to forget that there were government officials involved with a lot more than stealing podiums and smearing feces on the walls. They had every intention of stealing the election and trying to make it look legit with their roster of ""alternate electors"" to go along with all of their alternative facts.

Wisconsin Fake Electors Admit It Was All A Sham!,"Nobody ""admitted"" anything here.  To admit to something requires you to believe something that contradicted your previous position.  You can admit something that you knew- but didn't tell.  Or you can admit something that you knew, but now realize you wrong about.  But you can't *admit* something that you don't believe is true.  All you can do is lie about your belief in a manner that convinces others of your change of heart or revelation of previously hidden truths.  
  
In other words, just because they signed their names to a piece of paper doesn't mean that they truly agree with what it contains.  Effectively, this is a signature under duress regardless of however many assurances they make on paper or to authorities.  There is no remorse.  No change of attitude.  The admissions aren't worth the paper they were printed on.  
  
All this paper shows is that they are willing to pretend to be wrong in order to lessen the consequences of what they feel is a sham prosecution.  In their heart of hearts, they still believe they did nothing wrong.

1. Hospitals won't be able to milk more money out of Cox and any health insurance she has for the inevitable 10 other trips to the ER and her week in the hospital because she's carrying a dead fetus and they won't let the abortion happen until she's on death's door.

Further, this is a married woman.  You can't claim ""promiscuity"".  She wanted a child, and her husband is the fetus' father.  The only reason she is pursuing an abortion is because of the above.

This whole scenario is basically tailor-made to give Republicans a practically lab-grown example to point to and say, ""See?  We don't hate women, we just want their abortions to be *reasonable*!""  But instead, Paxton is bound and determined to force a woman to endanger her life and her fertility for... nothing.  Literally nothing.  There's no child to save.

First off, all those college professors said the wrong thing. Every single last one.  It's not hard to condemn genocide of any people.

If that were the case what they should have done is said, ""Obviously it's wrong to call for genocide of any race, and that they're institutions are holding to that tradition.""

Liz Magill resigns as UPenn president after disastrous hearing on antisemitism,"This entire comment section is like a case study in how Israel and right wing figures are damaging to the Jewish community, and yet all the blame gets thrown onto young people and the left. Jews are being conflated with the state of Israel, very successfully, by Netanyahu and US politicians to the point where anti-Zionism is being considered a type of anti-semitism. The conflation of a group of people with a state is insanely damaging.
Why is it damaging? Because young people are speaking out against violence. They are being called anti-Semitic for using a slogan that they use to oppose the Jewish state killing Palestinians. The saying opposes Zionism, not Jews!! But this conflation is being perpetuated and Jewish people are falling right into the hands of the right wing. 
Think about this in terms of BLM. When right wingers told us that BLM was a racist phrase, we didn’t suddenly believe them. We understood what they were doing by trying to condemn a call for peace. Imagine instead that this president had to resign because republicans complained that students were chanting BLM. That’s exactly what the republicans did here, except with “from the river to the sea.” The right doesn’t get to determine what these terms mean when they are being used as calls for peace and the ending of bombings. 
What makes this so disheartening is that Jewish people seem to be totally falling for all the violent right wing rhetoric they would have previously seen right through simply because they feel personally threatened. The rally in DC saw zionists booing when there was a call for a ceasefire. Because of the conflation of Israel and Jews, those who call for peace are now seeing Jews as being proponents of genocide. The state of Israel has done so much damage to the Jewish community around the world. As a person on the left, it’s seriously sad to see",0.92

B) Her name and face are everywhere.

C) The kind of people who cosplay as bounty hunters are exceedingly likely to be armed.

D) Going from the DFW area to an American state requires a 13+ hour drive through Gilead's rural areas. Oklahoma and Louisiana would likely honor their former fugitive slave laws.

Cox has zero power right now. She'd absolutely be apprehended at any airport and the odds of her navigating to New Mexico unmolested are nil.

And as soon as she's in legal custody, she'll get bulldozed until as such time had passed that she gives ""birth"" to a lump of dead flesh in a prison hospital.

There have been thousands injured by Israeli forces. In the same period, 143 Palestinian households (626 adults, 388 children) have been forced out of their homes because of Israeli settler violence. An additional 181 Palestinians (93 adults, 88 children) have been left homeless from Israeli forces demolishing their homes.

The transition away from monarchy, and the theory of separation of powers, both tend to bolster the potential legitimacy of such pardons. It is indeed quite possible that Congress or the judiciary might go after a president's friend or relative for corrupt/political reasons, and the president cannot even be sure that the *next president* won't try to pull some bullshit.

The only argument that has SOME merit for being more lenient with Hunter Biden's sentencing is if his punishment will place a high mental toll on the president AND this would likely negatively affect his judgement and ability to govern -- which in turn may create more human suffering through poor choices, but this is maybe a stretch",0.98

only on a selection of politically biased officials (ECF No. 167 at 1-2), but he does not and cannot
substantiate this theatrical claim. To the contrary, **as the defendant is aware from the discovery
that has been provided, the Government asked every pertinent witness**—including the former DNI,
former Acting Secretary of DHS, former Acting Deputy Secretary of DHS, former CISA Director,
former Acting CISA Director, former CISA Senior Cyber Counsel, former National Security
Advisor (“NSA”), former Deputy NSA, former Chief of Staff to the National Security Council,
former Chairman of the Election Assistance Commission (“EAC”), Presidential Intelligence
Briefer, former Secretary of Defense, and former senior DOJ leadership—**if they were aware of

presidential election. The answer from every single official was no.**

Republicans and insurance companies hated this and Republicans spent $Millions of taxpayer dollars trying to repeal the ACA multiple times. 

When Trump and Republicans ramped up their efforts in 2017, yelling they would repeal and replace, you had constituents at town hall meetings telling their Republican representatives, “Why are you trying to take away pre-existing conditions?  You’re threatening my life.” This was a question from a Republican who relied on life-saving medication to which Senator Grassley replied, “That’s not going to happen.”  But that’s absolutely what the GOP plan was.

The only answer is to extend the ACA benefits to cover everybody. Not M4A;  that's a terrible idea. I worked as a paramedic while I was going to college and still do it part-time, and Medicare pays such a small percentage of what we bill it literally doesn't cover overhead.

Insurance companies control healthcare. They’ve always been in bed with the doctors and politicians and Obamacare was the final nail they needed to put it away. Forcing people to have insurance was like giving the insurance companies a blank check. I think the rise in coverage costs in the US from 2013 to now is somewhere in the 130% increase range. Additionally hospitals doctors etc can charge as much as they want because everyone has “insurance”. Unfortunately for people who sit in the lower and middle class can’t afford “premium plans” and often find themselves in medical debt. It’s a shame and literally designed to keep American citizens dependent upon the government….. there is no incentive to work especially when you lose your benefits.

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"The incessant Chinese, Russian, North Korean, and Iranian social media disinformation campaign has worked yet again on the GOP and their MAGA faithful.  Blocking aid to Ukraine slows Europe’s ability to retool its military defense industry leaving us years behind the Chinese in missile and artillery stockpiles, while also denying Ukraine the tools needed to win or stalemate the war with Russia.

It won’t be funny the minute Taiwan is attacked and we are kept at arms length from defending our friends because of lack of foresight and effective missile systems!",0.97
Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,Wonder what America would be like if Congress sided with the Nazis and voted to stay out of that war.,0.97

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"It’s a good return on investment to weaken Russia in their own backyard. Likely a ton of military and political intelligence coming out of there as well that will benefit the US. 

The US is the largest single contributor but other EU countries are catching up. It’s not like we’re the only one. 

I can kind of see the argument of not throwing more money at it and spending it on our own needs, but the GOP keeps voting against spending bills that help Americans. They really can’t be considered serious people if they constantly undermine their own positions.",0.97
Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"Nothing makes Russia happier than Republicans supporting the Kremlin's agenda.  They really should spend some time studying Russian State media. China is watching. Iran is watching. North Korea is watching. In this war not only does Ukraine's existence hang in the balance, so to does the very idea of democracy. For it to survive Putin must be defeated.

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"So next year could be. Putin wins the war by Spring because Republicans cut off funding. Trump stands trial on national TV for trying to take the Presidency by force on Jan 6th. He is proven guilty and gets, let’s say, put on house arrest. Meanwhile Republicans are going to the polls and confirming that they want a potential felon to be President. In summer, Republicans officially nominate a convicted felon for President. The Supreme Court confirms that he can run, losing all their credibility as an institution and freeing him from house arrest. The stock market crashes because America looks like it could turn fascist. The right wing convinces voters that the market crash is because of Biden policies. Trump wins in November, Putin stands in a fully conquered Ukraine waiting for Trump to come in and pull out of NATO so he can invade the rest of Europe. 

Yeah, no, I’m good. I’m gonna sit this year out. I’ll vote blue down the line in November, but I can’t deal with this shit.",0.97

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,Any legal experts out there? At what point can we move to dissolve the GOP? It’s not even conservatism at this point(I used to be one of them). They’re no longer our fellow Americans that just happens to be on the other political aisle.

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"This is exactly how we continue to make people hate us. Isn’t that exactly what happened with Osama Bin Laden?

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,Well democrats can be blamed also because all they had to do was agree to securing our border also.

Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"Sigh... I want Ukraine to win. Really and truly. But this is getting stupid. We pushed them into doing a thing we'd never do ourselves; an assault against a fortified line with inferior numbers and no air cover. The results were predictable, and the most amazing thing is all the so-called military experts who seemed shocked that Russia spent last winter preparing instead of swilling vodka and holding circle-jerks. To judge by their public statements, they fully expected the Russian line to just collapse the moment the first Leopard tank rolled forward. I'm NOT a military expert, and even I called it better than they did.

Bottom line: unless NATO intervenes or Russia collapses internally, Ukraine will never retake the Donbas. It's time to re-align policy to reflect that reality.",0.97
Russia Celebrates Republicans Blocking Aid to Ukraine With a Missile Barrage,"Why is it up to America to subsidize a non-NATO European nation?

Don't get me wrong, the military aid to Ukraine is an absolute steal when it comes to weakening Russia. Bad political move to not do it.

But the comments here are absolutely unhinged. Republicans are traitors because we don't continue giving billions to a country that isn't obligated to it?? How about you righteous Biden voters go on over there and volunteer for the Ukrainian military.",0.97

1. Sharing explicit content between two parties via text has an implied level of privacy.
2. Sharing explicit content with public access does not. 

One can argue that the TOS agreement on the platform prohibits this and that's fine, but the cold calculus of the situation is that if you engage in activities on camera with public access assume those activities' will be recorded.

Loudermilk says blurring Jan. 6 rioters’ faces is to protect them from ‘insurrection hunters’,"""Insurrection hunters"" would hunt actual insurrectionists, yes? So then could they perhaps tell us *which side* they believe need to be protected from ""insurrection hunters""?

Because if the answer is ""Antifa"" then that means those who are blurring the faces ""are in on the crime"" and thus their supporters should be **furious** with them over this (that they aren't is quite telling that they damn well know what's actually happening and damn well know who actually went to J6).

If the answer is ""Peaceful Republicans who were protesting"", then it means said ""insurrection hunters"" would have had nothing to be hunting and no laws having been broken so there would be no DoJ interference, etc.

Both answers make no sense to the blurring of faces. it's their own supporters and they know it. That their supporters are **not** furious with them *for* blurring the faces means that their supporters **also** truly know it was their own side that did all this.

They don't seem to understand what critical thinking even is, let alone the basics or the fact that others who **do** critically think are capable of tearing their arguments to shreds in mere seconds. Doesn't even take much really, you only ever really have to go 1-layer deep into a concept they are fiercely defending and their argument collapses under the slightest bit of scrutiny.

Such as the argument of ""Antifa"" being there in the first place. Biden already won, it would have cost those Left-wing voters a shit ton of cash to get all the branded gear with Trump's name all over it that you can clearly see in all the pictures and resulted in the criminal trials of hundreds in attendance.

The Trump Prosecutions Are Cause to Celebrate the Rule of Law,"In one sense they are 

In another sense they're a very dire reminder of how woefully slow our system moves in contrast to how fast bad actors can move in the modern day with the advent of social media.

Donald Trump is also not a sophisticated actor. He is an idiot cudgel. A pants-shitting idiot of such base clumsiness that it is amazing he manages to dress himself each morning.

As a reminder to everyone, no legitimate law firms will even touch his cases. Hes plodding around unimaginably complex legal trials with the bottom-of-the-barrel lawyers who likely arent even putting very much effort into his defense.

And yet we still struggle with accountability.

Imagine if Trump were intelligent. Imagine if he were equipped with the backing of his political party because he knew how to at least feign loyalty to useful people and pay quality lawyers.

Can anyone seriously have confidence that our government would stand any chance against a savvy operator who didn't have the emotional and mental capacity of a fourteen year old?

Everyone in Trump's own party fucking hates him. Because he's useless, stupid, boorish, and can't keep his mouth shut.

For someone whose entire life is a lie, he is a remarkably unsophisticated liar. He can't hold a story together for two minutes. The last time he was in the stand he repeatedly incriminated himself and was thrown into a literal tantrum.

Imagine he wasn't that.  Imagine that, and be very fucking scared for how ill equipped we'd be to deal with a threat like that",0.96

Merrick Garland is a colossal failure at DOJ and is more responsibly from Trump viability as president than anybody else. 

Garland dragged his feet for 2 years and had to be shamed by the 01/06 Congress Commission into investigating Trump, he also waited just enough for Trump to declare a candidacy in order to announce and investigation.

Jack Smith was able to bring 2 indictments in two separate cases against Trump in 9 months.  Garland couldn't bring one in 2 years and a half.

Garland instead concentrated on charging the ""cannon fodder"" the misscreant low-level grunt soldier of Jan 06 with misdemeanors an a handful of low-level felonies.

VP Harris presses Israel on civilian deaths in Gaza. What does international law say?,"International law says that some of what Israel is doing might be illegal, and ALL of what Hamas is doing is definitely illegal.

It’s one of those situations like ISIS in Mosul, where it reached the point that the government decided they cannot coexist, the organization needs to be destroyed block by block if necessary.  

Now… urban combat is notorious for civilian casualties, especially if one side is using human shields.  On the other hand, the government cannot go back to the previous situation where they were just waiting for the other side to attack.

So honestly, I don’t see a good solution here.",0.85

Last I heard was around 25k - so 500kg for every potential terrorist, does not seem very targeted more like the ruSSian tactic of simply flattening everything. And they aren't finished ... how many terrorists did the IDF claim to have killed with those 25k tonnes of bombs till now?

Lets not kid ourselfs here - Israeli officals even said the quite part out loud ... multiple times. When you think of all Palestinians as terrorists and at best as 3nd class human beings it's quite easy to justify raising Gaza to the ground.

Texas Supreme Court halts order allowing emergency abortion,">The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily halted a lower court’s ruling that allowed a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant to get an abortion despite the conservative US state’s ban on the procedure.

I think after this latest Texas Supreme Court obscenity  the young woman should seriously consider leaving the Republican dominated christofascist state of Texas. In my view, remaining in Texas could increase the risks to her health, i.e., carrying a non-viable fetus. She needs to stay healthy both for her children's sake as well as her own.

If she can't afford to travel to a free state like California, etc., where abortion is legal, perhaps start up a Go Fund Me? Given how many Americans support her, I'm sure she'll likely raise  a million $$$  if not hundreds of thousands $$$  in no time to cover the costs.

People that have medical situations where they know there will be complications (per doctors, not politicians) are forced into waiting til practically death before Doctors are legally allowed to intervene, which, if the woman lives at that point(!) can often lead to that woman not being able to ever have children, no matter how much they want them.",0.96

The former was pretty much not gonna happen because Joe is 81 and something would of come out by now. The later being more possible for sure but I couldn’t place where in the world would be a conflict to erupt that change things. I definitely thought the Israel/Hamas conflict could be an issue (maybe) but I though “why? It’s a decades and decades old conflict how could it suddenly change into something we hadn’t seen before?” Man oh man was I right and very wrong at the same time! 

And now with the rise of people declaring themselves single issue voters next year, it’s become apparent that the most consequential voter block would be Gen Z.

3. Incomplete postmodernism, which despite some reconstruction (New Sincerity) still lacks Golden Rule of Morality core and don't incorporate fundamental western principles.

Because of which a significant portion of Americans don't understand how much Information Age, economic grow, accelerating technological progress changed World, and its cause-and-effect relationships, during last decades.

DeSantis Super PAC Cancels Donor Event Citing Waning Interest," The super political action committee backing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ presidential bid canceled a donor event this week due to a lack of interest from invitees, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest sign of the fresh tumult surrounding his 2024 run.                  The group, Never Back Down, planned to hold a luncheon ahead of the fourth Republican primary debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama — the site of the forum — according to the people who requested anonymity to discuss the cancellation. About 3,000 people were invited to purchase tickets.  
A $10,000 contribution would have given donors access to the lunch, where the governor’s wife, Casey DeSantis, was scheduled to speak, as well as a ticket to the debate itself and an invite to a post-debate celebration with the governor, according to an invitation.  
Days prior to Wednesday’s debate, Never Back Down decided to cancel the lunch. Scott Wagner, who leads the super PAC, cited a lack of interest as the explanation in his communication to the board, the people said.  
A spokesperson for Never Back Down did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wagner also did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                         
The last-minute cancellation highlights DeSantis’ political struggles and signals a lack of enthusiasm among his financial backers. DeSantis entered the race as the best-funded and most buzzed about Republican alternative to former President Donald Trump, but infighting between his campaign and Never Back Down, overspending, and sliding poll numbers have dampened his momentum.                                                                                                                            
The canceled event comes shortly after Never Back Down underwent a leadership shakeup, which resulted in three top officials departing the organization within weeks. Wagner, one of DeSantis’ closest allies and a Miami-based attorney, took over the group earlier this month. Phil Cox, who worked on the governor’s 2022 reelection campaign, also joined Never Back Down this week as a senior adviser.  
With just weeks until the Iowa caucuses, the DeSantis campaign faces a challenge in convincing Republican voters to support the Florida governor. He has not been able to pry voters away from Trump’s strong grip on the base, and recently, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has eaten into DeSantis’ support in Iowa and New Hampshire.",0.98

What Donald Trump's time in prison could look like,"1. No matter which court convicts him, his time will be spent in a federal supermax facility. Most likely in Colorado.  Given his age and condition, I suspect he will be in the med ward unit. 
2. At no time will he have inmate interaction. He is a security risk just like a drug kingpin or mass killer. There is no day room. Just his cell and the exercise yard.
3. Fed meals are decent fair but are scheduled  in 6 wk cycles. He will eat what is served or he won't eat. 
4. They will bring the shower stall to him if he doesn't use the one in the med unit with a nurse attendant. And 2 ever present guards within arms reach at all times outside his cell.
5. His interviews will be severely limited, and at no time will he have internet access except on the TV in his cell. His phone calls will be limited and recorded. His visits will be limited and recorded. 
6. There will still be a changing shift of secret service agents, but it will be a tiny detail. Well vetted. Never changed. 
7. Any and all depositions, court hearings, legal hearings, debrief, or interrogations will be held at the prison in its secure tv courtroom. He will not be transported to every trial or lawsuit. 

All that being said, my bet is he pulls a Trump and never serves a day, never pays his final bill, and cheats justice again-----

He was at one time, President of the United States. He is still considered an asset to the country. He knows a lot of information.

He’s stepped on every business partner so that’s a great representation to have for a president.   If he sees a map he doesn’t think fits with “his truth” he will just change the map and lie to everyone on earth to try and save face.  
There was an interview where a very young little trump lady was asking her dad why they didn’t have to pay or wait in line to watch a movie, now this was the 80’s, his response was we are special and we get free stuff all the time because we are so very special.
All the time he was saying this in front of kids and their dads that had been standing in line for hours to get in.

He’s a hypocrite, a lier, has no care for others, self-entitlement to an extreme.  What is it called when you think the rules don’t apply to you just to the people below you? Oh and let’s not forget get his charity that was deemed a fraud, his university, fraud, his steaks? Never ate one but at least we can call it a failed attempt.  And last but not least he’s a convicted rapest and all around pile of shit.

End of soapbox talk.

When some of their ilk inevitably operated on that information, they would openly celebrate. The DOJ  and law enforcement haven’t been as active in removing these people from society ([likely because they’re part of these groups](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jan-6-Clearinghouse-FBI-Intelligence-Assessment-White-Supremacist-Infiltration-of-Law-Enforcement-Oct-17-2006-UNREDACTED.pdf)) and the problem has only been exacerbated since then.

Look at how intense of a propaganda campaign the right has had to undergo with...Lia Thomas? Someone who did marginally well in one collegiate event? The first trans woman competing as a woman in the Olympics who...only got in because of covid boons to extra replacements and scratched out in her lift? You know Iran tried the ""nightmare scenario"" of loading up a soccer team with a bunch of questionably trans athletes one Women's World Cup right? Didn't really help them. The only real stereotype here is you transition young enough it's irrelevant or the mismatch of features makes you more injury prone.

You see it in this sub and particularly ""I'm not a liberal I'm a leftist"" spaces. It's all about maintaing some seed of prejudice. So many clearly need that, otherwise they have to look in the mirror and accept that in the 90s/early 00s when we were growing up a cartoonish degree of hatred against this community was the only acceptable opinion. Transphobia for Milennials is just like Racism for hell, not even Baby Boomers more like the casual level GIs were just accustomed to. It's not arguing about the issue, it's using arguing about an issue both sides always end up shrugging their shoulders and saying ""it's complicated"" on because people are getting something else out of the argument existing. 

Fox News didn't go all-in on sports because of Lia Thomas, she just convienently came along when they were neck deep in it. They did it to distract from Trump refusing to concede the election. They're all-in in sports because it's the little seed so many ""tolerant"" people hold on to to say a little bit of that old prejudice was justified. Makes it okay to start popping off about ""biological males"" or other dogwhistles. What...thought only fundies used those? Because at the end of the day the majority will typically choose something that makes them feel less bad about bigotry over addressing it. They need some seed to play with 10-15 years from now. This is how bigots act, they shuffle hatred around so people don't cotton on too much.",0.91

If Ukraine is abandoned,  (Europe cannot pick up the slack in time, they are also full of Russian co-conspirators like the Hungarian and Turkish governments),  this will absolutely lead to World War III.

Russia can't fight a war to save it's fking life.  but they have become the same kind of entity that Nazi Germany was.

Ultranationalist/Fascist,  Imperialist, Militarist,  Authoritarian, and Genocidal.  

they have switched to a war economy.  

When an entity like that switches to a war economy,Once  that monkey is out of the cage,  thats it, its done, full scale war will follow, and it wont stop until entire nations fall,

What Im saying here is that Russia has decided its time to make good on all the foolish jingoist fantasies they had,  the ukrainian army made a laughing stock of the russian one,  but that does not mean that the russians aren't dumb, or suicidally apathetic not to start an even larger war in the sake of Russkiy Mir.. (which is their psychotic Ultranationalist ideology that basically says half of europe belongs to Russia, and that they'll commit a nuclear holocaust to get it, if they have to)

They're going to keep picking fights with regional states until the time comes to declare Poland in need of denazification,  or one of the Baltic states.

Conventionally, Even without the US,  NATO would wipe the floor with the degraded and devolved Russian military, this is still a problem, because a suicidal, insane regime who's had it's ass kicked, will panic, and launch.

If America is under Trump's control, NATO is likely without the US, the British and French will be unable to contend with Russia's massive pile of nukes, and the Europeans will fold.  The Post WW2 Order will be long dead, and mass murder will be the new reality of the world.  and there will still probably be nukes.

And has nothing to show for it, especially in Afghanstan after 20+ years of occupation, it fell in a month to the Taliban. I'm sure the US could have used that money for the US...

But the money spent in Ukraine is mere billions -- ""mere"" by the comparison, not saying it's not a lot of money! -- and it has done the following:

\- Shown Russia's military to be hugely over-rated.

\- Sown doubt in any future buyers for Russian military technology, shown to be a paper tiger

\- Nearly killed off any advanced Russian military technology in the future

\- Set back Russia's economy by decades

\- Set back Russian economic diversification; the economy is almost fully dependent on oil exports now

\- Permanently skewed Russia's demographics for generations

\- Caused permanent harm to Russia's reputation, which a mere few decades ago, was a US rival and considered a ""Superpower"". Granted, any country with that many nuclear missiles still demands respect and caution, but short of the nuclear option, Russia is an international joke.

The US would have gladly paid trillions of dollars for the absolute and verifiable damage this Ukrainian war has done to Russia without the loss of a single American soldier.

Due to ban of soviet criticism on Nuremberg Trial and not opening of 1920-1960s soviet archives in the 1990s, mankind received too weak vaccination against 20th century mistakes. So now things will go anew.

7 billion dollars given, in 2002-2022 years, to Russia = western ""help"" in USSR industrialization/militarization.

Budapest Memorandum = Anglo-Polish alliance.

Merkel's Russlandversteher and 2015s Obama's: ""Western sanctions had left Russia isolated and its economy in ruins"" = Chamberlain's ""Peace for our time.""

Wars (Armenia/Azerbaijan), military coups (Burkina, Faso, Niger, Gabon), attacks (Hamas, Yemen Iran proxy), occupations (Guyana) and overall activity of North Korea, almost nuclear Iran, South Korea (statements about own WMD). Abundance of successful populists and autocrats.

The GOP’s abandonment of Ukraine makes me ashamed to be an American,"Hear me out:

Putin is a bad guy. He invaded a sovereign nation In order to take from them.

The battle lines are virtually stagnant now, with neither side gaining or losing much. They're fighting  for meters in a war of attrition.

Ukraine cannot win this kind of war. Russia just simply has more bodies and resources to throw into the meat grinder.

The GOP’s abandonment of Ukraine makes me ashamed to be an American,"Ngl, I could totally see another GOP candidate (not Trump) campaigning on abandoning Ukraine, winning, and then escalating the conflict. They're equally in the pocket of the military industrial complex as the democrats, and famously have done 180's on a variety of foreign policy issues:

- Nixon campaigned on peace in Vietnam, and then extended the conflict for 6 years.
- Reagan threatened to invade Iran, but sold weapons to islamist elements in the Levant
- Bush was an anti-intervention candidate, and started 2 forever wars in his first 3 years

It's important to recognize that the GOP is campaigning against Ukraine because American moderates (especially non-college educated people) don't strongly care about Ukraine or foreign policy. They might even be slightly antagonistic to the issue.

I think the exception to this rule is Trump- not because he's in the pocket of Putin (although he might be personally amenable to him), but because the issue is of relatively weak salience to his base.",0.86

'Rebuild the base': How the Biden campaign will tackle a possible Trump rematch,"They have so much ammo to use now. A lot of people are worried with the polling but remember many people aren’t yet paying attention and Biden’s campaign hasn’t even started. They’re sitting on a war chest larger than all Republicans candidates combined. The majority who are paying attention are right leaning as they have an actual primary season going on. The economy has been great by all numbers. It’s obvious to everyone this Biden impeachment is going to be a huge flop (already is actually). They’re also going to push hard about the federal judge appointments. It’s looking like best case scenario this next session will be a 50/50 senate split with the VP breaking ties.

You quite literally cannot recreate that enthusiasm & turnout and now a red line has been crossed. The VAST majority of democrats are calling for a ceasefire. Think about that. The MAJORITY of Biden’s party is vehemently against his actions in supporting a literal g*nocide. The Biden Admin has literally nothing else to campaign on.

As more and more of those state level policies happen, more and more people will see the benefits of govt intervention into our healthcare and those people will begin electing more Dems that want M4A, more judges that support it will be appointed, etc., until it's at the level the federal govt can pass it, the country can afford it and is willing to pay for it (and I don't mean congress but voters are willing to pay for it because the ticket price is daunting even if the pocket book price is not), and the courts won't strike it down.

If you can't love a child just the way they are unconditionally, you shouldn't be a parent.

The A.C.L.U. Has a New Client: The National Rifle Association,"> David Cole, the civil liberties group’s national legal director, said the request in one sense posed a hard question.

> “It’s never easy to defend those with whom you disagree,” he said. “But the A.C.L.U. has long stood for the proposition that we may disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it.”

> Mr. Cole’s group has been subject to occasional criticism that it has become less attentive to free-speech principles and more devoted to values rooted in equality in recent years. He rejected that critique, even as he acknowledged that the decision to represent the N.R.A. would not meet with universal praise.

> “It will be controversial, within and outside the A.C.L.U.,” Mr. Cole said. “But if it was easy, it wouldn’t mean as much.”

> He added: “In this hyper-polarized environment, where few are willing to cross the aisle on anything, the fact that the A.C.L.U. is defending the N.R.A. here only underscores the importance of the free speech principle at stake.”

> ...

> “If Maria Vullo can do this to the N.R.A., then why couldn’t a regulator in Texas do it to an immigrants’ rights group or a regulator in Arkansas do it to Planned Parenthood?” he asked.

> He added that federal officials could also abuse their power under the appeals court’s ruling. “Donald Trump has made no bones about his desire to retaliate against his opponents,” Mr. Cole said. “This would be a playbook for him to do exactly that.”",0.84

Biden to Big Pharma: Gouge Prices and We’ll Snatch Your Patents,"As a citizen, I'm all in favor of this. 

As a patent holding scientist in biotech, I am also in favor of this. I will give a super basic reason why prices can be so crazy that isn't just ""greed"". It's mostly greed but not only. Here is an example timeline for a drug from the perspective of an inventor and pharma company and some very rough insight into pricing:

2005: Dr. X receives an NIH grant to study gene editing in Sickle Cell Anemia. There's about 180k new cases a year. It's considered to be a rare disease, but not super rare. Rare is ""someone you know may have it"". Very rare is ""someone you know knows someone who has it it"". Ultra rare is ""you came up with a mnemonic for it when you studied it for your boards"". 

2008: Dr. X gets promising results that may apply to this disease and contacts their patent office at the university they work, as all scientists are encouraged to do.

2009: Dr. X writes and drafts a provisional patent application, with the offices help. The university foots the entire legal bill, ultimately owning anywhere from 60-90% of it. Once this provisional patent application is submitted to the patent office, the clock has started on exclusivity. A 20 year non-extendable clock. To compare patent timing with copyright, Steamboat Willie's copyright, the famous Walt Disney Short from 1928, will expire in 2024. 

2010: Once filed, the university puts its interesting tech on the web for investors and pharm to see. 

2011: A big pharma says 'oh wow, this is great, we'd like to invest in it/license it'. Awkward talks occur between people with the same letter degrees from the same twenty institutions but vastly different salaries and life choices (inventors and pharma people). They want to pursue this further! Agreements are made and signed. 

2012: The drug, with tens and tens of millions of dollars is prototyped, developed, tested on animal models. Early studies indicate the mice haven't died! Nice!

2013: The patent, taking priority date from the provisional, is awarded. Clock is still going. 

2014: Phase 1 human trials begin. This involves a medium sized network of places recruiting human participants, each site being paid to recruit a small number of people, with staffing and all the trimmings of safety and monitoring in place. Might cost 10 million (a regular good ol grant is 3-5 million over 5 years so this is not crazy). So far so good.

2018: Phase 2 trials begin. Here, more people are recruited, the cost goes up 10x. Maybe into the hundred(s) of millions of dollars now. 

2020: Phase 3 trials begin, phase 2 results begin to trickle in. Data are promising, costs go up 5x across the country. You submit a paper to New England Journal of Medicine, the most prestigious journal for clinical medicine, on the positive results of this drug. It gets in. The disclosures are replete with equity, sponsored research agreements, consulting and straight pharma dough. They're (the drug company) is paying for the research, after all.

2021: Company examines feasibility of marketing, manufacture, delivery, reimbursement models, efficacy and many more things about getting product to market. Clock is still running. Submit to FDA formally, have many many back and forths. They come up with a terrible name for it, [like what Mike Tyson would answer when asked who his favorite female character on the office is](https://www.rxlist.com/philith-drug.htm).

2023: Phase 3 appears successful. Solidify pricing strategy. Wait for FDA approval while you get a rough idea that it will be approved. Huzzah! They approve. Likely at least until next year until you have a patient paying for it. 

2024: First patient receives the drug, and, most importantly, first insurance reimbursement of the drug.  

You now have five years (until 2029) left before you lose exclusivity. Patents are not a secret ingredient, and other companies will secretly making sure the nanosecond the patent expires they can be ready with an alternative. You think about charging between 1-3m for the cost of the drug which is absolutely outrageous. But you've easily sunk perhaps billions into getting to this point. This chart may be totally off but it should be a rough estimate of why, once that patent is filed, it's a race to do with a drug what you can for whatever cost you want. And drug companies can be and usually are super evil, but they have the capital and infrastructure to see things reach patient hands or arms. The only time the government paid for this research was that first non-trivial initial grant (and perhaps grants in between, but still small potatoes). They bought you your first drum kit, now you're playing Wembley. 

This is in no way a defense, and I'm sure I'm off about some things, but this is not too crazy a scenario. Drugs are still crazy expensive and pharma companies as greedy as they come. But the huge amount of R&D that goes into it is not trivial. They want to recoup expenses which is fair, but have done so aggressively and at the expense of people in need of drugs. 

BTW, the first ever gene editing therapy ever was approved today by the FDA today for, you guessed it, sickle cell anemia.",0.97

The right-wing insane asylum would like to think this is overreach, even if it would be amazing for America in total (Republicans do not care about stuff like that. They are about beating the other team at all costs). But it's utterly within our right to tell profiteers that their bullshit is harming America, so the will of the people are going to take your toys away.

That said, this will do two things that may doom Biden:

1. Pharma has **billions** of dollars they can spend in retaliation. They will absolutely spend all that money to stop this from happening by making sure he doesn't get re-elected.
2. This gives republicans something to talk about other than abortion. They will find some way to spin this, it doesn't matter a lot as long as people aren't talking about abortion.

They fund NOTHING that doesn't ""pencil"" on the P&L, which means rare but heinous disease gets no attention at all.  They're literally useless and unguided in the healthcare arena.

Biden to Big Pharma: Gouge Prices and We’ll Snatch Your Patents,"While the threat is novel it’s just that a novel idea. Aside the fact that this is an untested legal which will get tied up in courts as soon as it’s invoked the real issue is the patent alone doesn’t control the price. 

So the feds take th patent then what? If they try and make it generic then they give more legal ammo against the law. Private property was seized and value destroyed without just compensation. 

Next up who is going to manufacture the drug based on the patient? The patent alone doesn’t include the information needed to produce and distribute the drug.  This another huge legal area. The feds can try and use the ownership (or implied threat) as a means to get the manufacture to lower the cost but again legal shaky ground. The US gov is going to get into the open extortion business?

Finally drug pricing isn’t just a function of the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Seizing the patent doesn’t change the PBM pricing and dispensery model. It doesn’t change the wholesalers. It doesn’t change the commercial insurance model. It doesn’t change the pharmacy model. It doesn’t change the drug administrator model. 

Unless the feds are willing to take on everyone in the entire chain and tell them all are going to lose money seizing the patent won’t do much. 

You want to make a difference? Vote. The biggest driver of drug prices is what the fed pays through all of its programs. Give them the ability to negotiate without constraints and prices will come down.",0.97

I'm all for all the cheap drugs in the world but enforcing through Government seizure is an Authoritarian or Communist action.

Like, what happens when they seize the patent to the morning after pill and it becomes unavailable or available on a prescription from a specialist unavailable to the lower and medium socio-economic groups?

Hasn't Donald Trump taught any of you that expecting law makers to adhere to the intent of law is a completely devoid thought these days.

They will take that power and subvert it, providing the apparatus, even with a good thought and good initial gains is fraught with possible (guaranteed in this climate) abuse.",0.97

This means that the original company can still make the drug, they would just have to compete on price with the other companies.

So these companies would still be able to make money because after all, companies aren't going to make the drug and then sell it at a loss.

Hunter Biden: Republicans are trying to ‘kill me’ to destroy father’s presidency,"They are. The GOP has long been infiltrated by US foreign enemies probably decades ago by now. The Mueller Report certainly seemed to shine a light on just how fragile everything else. 

Please note just vote, but understand who and why you're voting too. Don't take your right to vote for granted. This isn't over. 

The majority of people under 50 rather than over it are about to have power and the narcissistic insane people over 50 who have not accepted their own mortality are scrambling inside to retain power and control over The Masses.

The most controlling people tend to be the most psychopathic and MAGA has spread a lot of psychopathy as a personality trait intentionally across the nation. We **need** to vote that out if we have any shot at protecting the right to vote and the rights we consider to be inalienable, inherent, and what we're born with. 

Even the abortion ""debate"" at all was a distraction for a long time to eventually use it as an excuse to control women's bodies to make more workers for capitalism and since capitalism is now failing and blatantly so they're scrambling like cockroaches.

We see that in the fact that the GOP love to cut SNAP, TANF, and any program meant to help children and families or well anyone that might need help and works and contributes to the system but the system isn't giving them enough to live. The GOP repreensts the corporate interests keeping people so poor, all the work around them cannot generate enough to live. 

The GOP is attacking Hunter to deflect from being held accountable. They know that most of Trump's children knew they were committing felons regularly and are preparing for that inevitability. It makes good sense to wait to really press those charges until right before the election. 

Of course Hunter volunteered to speak to the GOP members attacking him and they declined because they're weak in reality, old, time is not on their side anymore. But you know what? Millennials don't stop paying attention to who you vote for, what they do, who they are and what they stand for.  You can vote this BS out and get it out but you can't stop now. 

The GOP fears being held accountable because accountability sheds a light on their dysfunction and lies. They know they're lying and just don't care, and that's the problem isn't it. How do you make them care? You assure they have consequences for their behavior. You vote them out, you get rid out them by going to the ballot box.

Hunter Biden: Republicans are trying to ‘kill me’ to destroy father’s presidency,"*FACTS*

This week, the president took a question from Steven Nelson of the New York Post— a reporter whom White House Press Secretaries Karine Jean-Pierre has refused to call on since May.

Nelson pointed to an Associated Press poll that found that nearly 70 percent of Americans, including 40 percent of Democrats, believe Biden acted illegally or unethically regarding his family's business ventures. 

“Can you explain to the Americans, amid this impeachment inquiry, why you interacted with so many of your son and brother’s foreign business associates?” Nelson asked. 

In no shocking response, Biden reverted to his tried and true defense mechanism: lying…

“I did not. And it’s just a bunch of lies. They’re lies. I did not. They’re lies,” the 81-year-old president said.

Following Biden’s denial, Hunter Biden’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski called on the president to ""stop lying"" and “correct the record” about his 2017 meeting. 

“Why is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people and the world by claiming he did not meet me face to face?"" Bobulinski responded. ""He should call his son Hunter and brother Jim as they can remind him of the facts. The American people deserve the truth!""",0.96

FACT SHEET: President Biden Announces Billions to Deliver World-Class High-Speed Rail and Launch New Passenger Rail Corridors Across the Country,"People need to realize several things about Biden:

-He is working in a presidency right after a destroyed dismantled country that Trump created. He is still undoing all the damage to government institutions the Republicans caused.

-He is working AROUND a near 50/50 divided Senate (probably less due to traitors Manchin and Cinema)

-He has passed countless useful legislation and has helped launch legal ideas to get around barriers to pass it

-The media is owned by billionaires and purposely NEVER mentions the reality of items his presidency has passed

-There is a smear campaign to attempt to make Biden look bad on Israel. In reality, he is trying to balance Israel and Palentine's precarious situation, moreso than past presidents.

As someone who suffered several miscarriages and had a medical abortion of a VERY MUCH wanted baby at 18 weeks because of a fatal abnormality, fuck the GOP.  

We took a rental car (we were worried protestors might try to dox our license plate) and made the 4 hour drive to the one abortion clinic in my state. It is a 2 day procedure so we also had to rent a hotel room. 

My husband and I had to deal with protestors yelling at us- FUCK THEM ALL.  Due to security reasons, we couldn’t  bring anything inside the building but the cash to pay for it and my ID.  We had to go through metal detectors and 2 sets of security doors  to enter the waiting room. 

Waited 3 hours. They screened me, gave me a prescription. Picked it up, went to the hotel for a very gloomy and long night where we said goodbyes to our little Liam.  In the morning and deal with protestors again. They put my under and I went through the procedure. 

My miscarriages were tough but they were early on. This was a soul wrenching loss because we were so far along, had a nursery and a name. Having mental religious assholes calling me a murderer was vile. Bless the volunteers who met us at the car with giant golf umbrellas to shield me and immediately started talking to me in an effort to distract me from the “loving Christians” calling me a killer. 

After that I told my husband I was done trying to have another child - I couldn’t handle having a repeat of what we just went through. We had one healthy daughter, and I guess that’s all the universe meant for us to have. 

Now these poor women have the weight of the state and courts to deal with on top of the mental anguish.

So I'm going to assume ""paying a witness"" is not too untoward, and that this is a fee to have a accounting professor review the charges and give his opinion as someone who works in the field (an expert witness) in which case this part seems above board.

But that cost seems pretty ridiculous, I know costs can be interesting in the professional world (I work as a survey tech, back when I was making 26 an hour I glanced at our bill to the client and saw my rate to the client was about 50 an hour, plus I know we inflate the billing, and a professional surveyor with a license would typically bill at 150+ per hour).

"Billionaire GOP donor endorses Haley, says Trump’s time has ‘come and gone’","I'm really hoping the GOP backs her big time and she ekes out the nod.

I know a die hard Maga guy at work and he said he wouldnt vote for Haley because she one of those ""d** heads"" 

So yeah, good luck promoting Nikki Haley to the fringe MAGA types voting.

But then again, she would pardon Trump and she has said things that make her a psychopath. Says one thing to the public, then goes on Fox promoting bullshit conspiracy shit.

Either way, it seems like the GQP wants her to be the one running so they're taking actions to prep her up gradually as opposed to making it obvious which will anger the Trumpers.

Why Is One of Trump’s Fake Electors Still Overseeing Voting in Wisconsin?,"very damn good question, right?   And in a swing state too.",0.98
Why Is One of Trump’s Fake Electors Still Overseeing Voting in Wisconsin?,"The Wisconsin Republican insiders who, in their guise as so-called “fake electors,” collaborated in former president Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, have finally admitted that Joe Biden won the battleground state.

It took the better part of three years, but on Wednesday the 10 Republicans who set themselves up as fake electors for Trump—and then filed paperwork that falsely claimed the former president won Wisconsin’s electoral votes—formally acknowledged the reality that their candidate had been defeated by the Democrat.

The fake electors, waited for 35 months to do the right thing. And then only under the looming threat of a civil trial that was unlikely to go well for them.

The Republicans abandoned the “big lie” as part of an agreement to settle the suit, which was brought by Democratic voters and electors who accused them of participating in a multi-state attempt by Trump and his partisan allies to reject the 2020 election results. They could have been liable for as much as $2.4 million in damages if they had lost at trial. To see off that threat, they accepted an agreement that required them to recognize that Biden won Wisconsin and to withdraw their false filings with public officials that received the Electoral College votes.

“The duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020 presidential election were: [Democratic Biden electors] Meg Andrietsch, Shelia Stubbs, Ronald Martin, Mandela Barnes, Khary Penebaker, Mary Arnold, Patty Schachtner, Shannon Holsey, Tony Evers, and Benjamin Wikler,” read the statement the Republicans agreed to. “We hereby reaffirm that Joseph R. Biden, Jr. won the 2020 presidential election and that we were not the duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020 presidential election.”

The fake electors also agreed to file a statement with the public officials who received their documents, in which they admitted to having been “part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results.”

Perhaps most notably, the Republicans—including a former state party chair and many longtime party leaders—agreed that they would not attempt to serve as electors, fake or otherwise, in 2024 or any other future election in which Trump is running for president.

One of the fake electors, Milwaukee County Republican activist Robert Spindell, still serves on the Wisconsin Election Commission, thanks to an appointment by Wisconsin State Senate majority leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg). This means he helps administer elections in a state whose last presidential election he deliberately tried to sabotage.

That never made sense, and good government groups such as the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and Common Cause Wisconsin have, for many months and many reasons, been calling on LeMahieu to rescind the appointment. Instead, the Senate leader has endorsed Spindell for a new term on the commission that will extend through the 2024 election.

So Spindell could very well end up as one of the commissioners overseeing the 2024 presidential election in the state, even if Trump is on the ballot.

That means that a Republican who is legally barred from serving as an elector for Trump could be making decisions about voter registration, voting, and vote counts in an election where Trump is likely to be the GOP nominee.

Mike Browne, of the advocacy group A Better Wisconsin Together, says, “It is unacceptable and it’s inappropriate for someone who admitted they tried to improperly overturn a presidential election to have any role of public trust administering elections in the state of Wisconsin going forward.”

Unacceptable. Inappropriate. And absurd, says Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair Ben Wikler. Of course, Wikler’s a partisan who served as a legitimate elector—for Biden—in 2020. On the other hand, he’s never tried to overturn a free and fair election, and he’s got a point that goes beyond partisanship.

“No matter your party or who you voted for, honoring the outcome of a free and fair election is core to American democracy. As these 10 fake electors now admit, their actions violated this bedrock principle of our democracy in an attempt to overturn an election that Donald Trump plainly lost. It is now time for the next step in accountability,” says Wikler, who argues, “LeMahieu must remove Robert Spindell from the Wisconsin Election Commission. Leader LeMahieu must make clear that there is no place in our system of election administration for an individual who now admits to conspiring to overturn an election.”",0.98

"Michigan GOP, on ‘the brink of bankruptcy,’ broke campaign finance laws, report alleges","This is what happens when you elect extreme ideologues to hold state and local office. Historically, fascists are so blinded by dogma that they are exceptionally impaired when it comes to evaluating risk in any given situation. This leads to poor decision making and eventual systematic failure.

The dangerous part, which is the part we are still currently in, mind you, is when fascists finally realize they are fucked and become increasingly desperate to avoid the consequences of their own actions. We are currently witnessing the beginning of the death throes of the fascist movement in the US. We have to do *everything we can* to prevent them from gaining power in the 2024 cycle, and likely until 2028, while they become even more bold in their attempts to subvert democracy in order to save their own skin.

January 6, 2021 was the US equivalent of [Germany’s 1923 Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch). The German people and institutions failed to understand the gravity of the fascist threat over the next decade. Hitler was appointed chancellor in 1933 and immediately began abolishing state institutions (similar to how [Project 2025](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025) seeks to dismantle independent executive departments) in order to consolidate power. One of the first organizations targeted by the Nazis was the German [Institute for Sexual Research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft#:~:text=The%20Institute%20was%20a%20non,Berlin%2C%20on%206%20May%201933), which was the first organization to study LGBTQ+ issues.

Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,As Democrats always need to do after dumbass voters elect a Republican,0.95
Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"There is, as usual, a bit of revisionist history regarding Trump's economy being amazing. Let's just briefly take a look at that point.

During Trump's presidency, a lot of the guardrails--the tools that would allow the administration to deal with a global catastrophe--were getting stripped down. There were articles on this as far back as 2018. One valuable example is interest rates. Trump pressured the Federal Reserve to keep rates low, despite it being in theory a good time to raise them (the US being in a boom period). Then COVID hit. As a result of that effort to deregulate, the US couldn't do much to stem the effects, resulting in a $6T loan to the stock market, among other things, that were what you'd describe as drastic measures.

As a consequence, while Trump certainly didn't cause COVID-related implosion, he's responsible for the degree of the problem at least in part, and some of the inflation thereafter also results from those desperate measures.",0.95
Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,Trump was all about immediate gratification to look good. Burning the cabin furniture in the fireplace for warmth without regard to the future and greater problems that would result,0.95
Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"Of course he is, this is how it always works. Repubs take control and ride the coattails of democratic highs, crater the economy and then blame democrats when they take control and fix it. Ditch the electoral college and elect people by popular vote and we won’t have this problem again for a long time. Trump, alone, added 25% of the current national debt. Fuck him and all those like him.",0.95
Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"As has been the normal cycle of American politics for as long as I can remember. Republicans fuck it all up and Democrats follow behind them cleaning up the Repub's mess.

Edit: One analogy I had that came to mind. 

Imagine the horse and rider that we see in a parade. The rider is there for show making their horse walk, trot and canter. This is the republicans. The democrats are the poor saps with their broom/shovel, pan and 50 gallon garbage can on wheels walking behind the horse sweeping up the horse's shit.

This is the parade and shit show known as American politics.

Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"Doesn’t matter. He’s speaking to an audience that doesn’t see it or doesn’t care. Most Americans have no idea how job reports correlate to the economy.

Saying Trump left a wrecked economy doesn’t make up for the fact that so much is still out of reach, and inaccessible. Americans are not intelligent enough to vote with logic and reason. They’re going to vote based on the asinine prices of daily necessities.",0.95

Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"Whenever there is a Republican president in office, we hear no complaints from their supporters about the economy or inflation as their leader (Reagan, Bush, Trump, take your choice) plummets our economy deeper and deeper into debt. They bury their heads in the sand at tax breaks given to the most rich being sold as ""trickle down"" (never does), too brainwashed w misinformation to see GOP leaders are always total fiscal failures. As soon as a Democrat wins and starts to help us recover, they suddenly all scream about the mess their choice left behind, demanding instant results, as told by their false info outlets. Democrats need to develop a louder, angrier voice to bring this GOP pattern of terrible fiscal management (while blatantly lying they are the stable ones) more into the light, this country has suffered enough from their costly (to those not rich) lies about WMD, invisible middle class tax breaks, free tax rides for their corporate owners, etc.",0.95

Biden campaign says jobs report shows he is ‘cleaning up the economic disaster’ Trump left,"For 2+ years the media was desperate to sell the public on a coming recession, that messaging succeeded in delivering the House to GOP control even though most voters saw through it and re-elected Democrats in a large wave when normally the incumbent party loses in large numbers.  That Biden and the Dems were able to overcome all that messaging and still deliver and are still doing so now, to ensure everyone is better off or positioned to be better off than they were when Trump left the Presidency is incredibly important should be celebrated more, even if anecdotally there are examples of people ""feeling"" different.

Paxton asking TX Supreme Court to Force a woman to give birth to a non viable fetus,"Here is a simple summary of the article:

🤔 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the state Supreme Court to step in and stop a woman in Dallas from having an abortion. He did this because a judge said the woman, Kate Cox, could end her pregnancy that can't survive outside her body. Paxton also sent letters to three hospitals, warning that he might take them to court if they let the abortion happen. This is the first time since a famous legal case in 1973 that a pregnant woman has gone to court to get an abortion. A similar case in Kentucky is being looked at too. 

Paxton wants the Texas Supreme Court to make a decision quickly because he thinks waiting means more abortions might happen. The court is also considering another case where women say they were denied abortions when they needed them for medical reasons. The state says these women can't sue because they aren't asking for abortions right now. Cox's lawyers say she can't wait for the court's decision because it might take a long time. Now, the court has to consider both cases and make a decision quickly. The main question is whether it's okay for a woman to have an abortion if her baby won't survive and it's a danger to her health and future ability to have children. Cox's lawyers say it's necessary to protect her. A judge agreed and said it would be unfair to make Cox keep the pregnancy. But the state disagrees and says the judge's ruling would let more women have abortions even when it's not medically necessary. 

Cox's lawyer also wrote a letter asking the judge to have a hearing about Paxton's threats against the hospitals. They think he should be in trouble for what he said. Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar spoke out against Paxton's actions and said it's terrible what happened to the woman who needed the abortion.

Texas state statutes diligently protect doctors from assuming any accountability or financial responsibility when their gross negligence kills their patient. Malpractice insurance is set to cover the caps and nothing is reported to the medical board.

Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocks pregnant woman from emergency abortion,"“On Friday the Texas theocratic regime leaders demanded that a woman submit to further regime inquiry before she was able to access necessary healthcare services. 

Women in Texas are deprived of the right to access reproductive healthcare, unlike other counties in the most of the world, unless the theocratic state religious court scholars deem it life saving. Her fetus will not survive long if it does not die in the womb. The mother faces possible death, illness, or  loss of fertility if the pregnancy continues. The regime however does not find these outcomes serious enough to allow her to end her pregnancy.

Religious mandates force women to carry pregnancies to term against their will under the regimes mandates. Zealous self appointed militants seek out women and any who aid them to turn in to the state for bounties in Texas if they attempt to terminate even non-viable pregnancies.”

Where Are All the Anti-Trump Republicans? A vast array of GOP power brokers detest and disdain the former president. So why are they keeping so quiet?,"Damage control is everything.  

When Trump was in office: damage control.

When Trump is out of office: damage control.

Republicans are trying to save their party.  They also have a huge problem with voters not moving away from Trump and voter money not moving away from Trump.  Plus corporate donors don't really know what to do because so much of the party is bat shit crazy or incompetent.  Even Nicky is a hard sell for both corporate and public bases.  But, everyone else is just worse.

Now here's Trump ever popular with a large swath of the Republican voter base even though he'll very likely be both broke and in prison (fancy prison maybe, but still prison) before election day.  Even so, they can't just drop him without making a lot of their party angry.  Media had the exact same problem.  All their eggs are in the same basket going to hell, ans there's no out that won't massively hurt.

The hardest part right now is numbers.  The Republican party was already down millions of votes over the last several presidential elections.  The majority of their voter base is built on shrinking demographics, like not one, most, most demographics.  Old, white, religious, Covid denying, uneducated, and rural.  In terms of demographics, that's not what you want.  Additionally, that whole group has been grifted by Trump for almost a decade now.  Trump has profiteered north of 8 billion dollars from this demographic.  They are now cash poor meaning the Republican party also has terrible cash flow.  Voters nor only don't want any of the candidates.  They don't even have cash to give them even if they wanted to.  Many of the members are struggling for cash, and remember, the ones that are debating ARE the ones with backers.  Ans they're still basically too broke to campaign.

Will corporate America swoop in and save them?  Eh...  We're seeing some, but even if Nicki is getting a cash infusion, if she's not remotely viable for the run, corporations won't bet on a lame horse.  This might be a season where we see corporate America just sit this one out.  Or might be just a freebie for 4 years and then try with a better set of candidates.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Houston voters to decide whether John Whitmire or Sheila Jackson Lee will be mayor,"From the article:

> Voters in Houston on Saturday are picking between two long-serving Democrats in the runoff to determine the next mayor of Texas’ largest city.
> 
> The ballot features state Sen. John Whitmire and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the top two finishers in the initial November election to lead the fourth most populous city in the country.
> 
> The winner will succeed Mayor Sylvester Turner, who is term-limited.
> 
> The office is nonpartisan, though Whitmire and Jackson Lee are both well-known Democrats with long tenures and powerful allies. Whitmire has served in the Senate since 1983, making him the chamber’s most senior member.
> 
> . . . 
> 
> Whitmire has run on a platform of increasing public safety, fixing streets and reducing cronyism at City Hall. He has also promised to improve the relationship between Houston and the Republican-led Legislature in Austin.
> 
> Jackson Lee has also focused on bread-and-butter issues but positioned herself as a more reliable Democrat who would stand up to “MAGA extremists.” She has the support of national Democratic figures such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton.


As a Houstonian, I admit that I'm disappointed that this race has played out the way it has. Very early in the race, there were a couple younger politicians seeking the office and I was interested in hearing what new ideas they were going to bring with them, but then the old guard politicians got involved and the younger ones dropped out.",0.95

Far-right Christians are not being persecuted but have a persecution complex.  And it makes sense.  It's hard to make a claim that a marginalized group with little legislative power over their own future, are ripping the country apart and taking away Christians rights.

And they HAVE to create a narrative as to why these people's lifestyles are a threat to anyone else, because otherwise, it's gonna look like far-right Christians DONT believe in freedom for all Americans, but instead want to tell others how to live, using laws to force them.  So they tell people that the LGBTQ community is brainwashing their kids and convincing Democrats to cut off the penises of their children.

When you have to lie to sell your narrative, YOU are the baddie.  Fact is, what this REALLY comes down to is desperation by the far right to maintain control.  Church attendance is dropping every year and young people aren't registering Republican at nearly the numbers of Democrats.  On top of that, I think it *might* actually seem like persecution to some bc when you belong to a group, that has had an unconstitutional amount of privilege for over a century (white, male Christian), losing the privilege might appear like they are being treated unfairly.  It's just no longer popular to be conservative because the party has gone SOOO far right, they keep mumbling ""Civil War"" in this country, but not in a ""wouldn't it be tragic if America found itself in a situation where brother is fighting brother again?"", but instead one of excitement.  They look forward to Civil War.  That is not only unhealthy, it's insane.

Get out the vote. I really want Cheney, Kinzinger, the RAC and any other R org that sees Trump for what he is to espouse this philosophy.

2024 is about keeping Trump out of office. Focus on that mission, and do whatever it takes to achieve that. And that means coalescing behind a single anti-Trump vote. Right now, thats Biden/Harris.

Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger describes himself as politically ""homeless,"" at odds with a party he views as ""anti-constitutionalist."" He believes former President Donald Trump will be the 2024 Republican nominee — and if that's the case, Kinzinger intends to vote for President Biden.

Kinzinger was one of two Republicans to serve on the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot that sought to derail congressional certification of Biden's victory.

The other Republican on the committee was Liz Cheney, who says she's considering a third party bid for the White House, although she told CBS ""Mornings"" Thursday, ""I won't do anything that would help him,"" she said, when asked about possibly running as a third-party candidate.

Trump is so uniquely polarizing that he has absolutely opened a crack in the GOP. There is this brief window Democrats have to capitalize. 

Give these moderate Republicans a new home. Get folks like Kinzinger to move just a little bit more to the center and let run as Democrats. I think most of us have that 1-2 friends or family that have been Republicans for their whole lives that hate Trump and either didn't vote or voted Biden in 20. 

What I have seen is that these folks will say that they are fiscally conservatives, socially liberal. Cut my taxes, tough on crime, fund my schools, legalize pot, and not my bedroom not my business. These folks have just been so conditioned to vote GOP and it has become ""their team"". Get them to feel comfortable with voting blue a few times and change their team and you can lock in those voters for more than 1 cycle. 

Trump is going to die one day, and these folks will absolutely go back to the fold for someone like Haley. Unfortunately, the GOP has shown that there would be almost no difference in domestic policy between the two.

Your job is upset because you didn't sign the *loyalty pledge*. Your kid gets kicked out of private school for refusing to *pledge allegiance* to Trump.

You know he's wrong, you know he can't be put in charge, you know in your heart, that a lot of good people will suffer, and not just the people you don't like, but many people who you do like.

You know that he doesn't care about the constitution, or your rights, or your lives. He won't help you pay your mortgage, he won't make things better for poor people. He only cares about him.

If the few sane old school Republicans decide to peace out, there might emerge a more robust Independent party than we've ever seen.

Gigantic corps own a microscopic share of the single family home market.  


Granted, corps own a majority of apartment buildings. There's a BIG difference.  


This whole malarkey stems from the wild and false rumor that Blackrock is buying up all the single family homes. Patently false, check their website.  


Blackstone however, has ventured into the market with a teeny tiny miniscule share. They happily clarify just how much and how their tiny portion doesn't even effect the market at all. Again, check their website.  


However, this all goes back to the days when Florida and Blackrock parted ways over their funds and pensions focusing on green energy and sustainability. That's your real story.

What Companies Have Been Buying Up All the Single-family Homes?

&#x200B;

  
The one major misconception about the investor-homebuying myth is that big, faceless companies are the largest force in buying houses. While large corporations certainly play a hand in shaping the market landscape, they only made up around 3% of American home sales in 2021 and only 1% in previous years. In reality, most home purchases in the investor space are made by smaller, localized groups. Everyone and their broker are trying to get into the real estate market. Today we see hedge funds, private equity firms, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, and even mom-and-pop landlords taking a more active interest in rental housing.

create a debilitating tax penalty for single family homes not owned by a ssn holder, like 10,000% increase to force quick the sale by corporation, LLCs, hedge funds, etc.

GOP Star Tim Sheehy Forgot to Mention the Family Money in His ‘Self-Made’ Success Story,"Here is the beginning of the story:  


As he introduces himself to Montana voters, top GOP U.S. Senate recruit Tim Sheehy has highlighted his experience “bootstrapping” the successful aerial firefighting company he launched in the state.  


Talking to party luncheons and interviewers, Sheehy’s success story about Bridger Aerospace has sounded like a gritty start-up tale that began with a dream and some savings, not “freebies,” as he put it in a podcast interview.  


“When I saw a business opportunity, I took my entire life savings—I didn't get a government loan, didn’t get a government handout—I started a business in my barn and built it from scratch,” Sheehy told a crowd in August.  


“We had a nice little six-figure nest egg, and we just booted off our company with that,” Sheehy said on a November podcast appearance. “We bought our land, and we lived in a tent, literally, for months, and we built the barn that we lived in for four and a half years. And it was like bootstrap central.”  


Sheehy’s sterling resume and colorful backstory has made him such a highly prized recruit for Senate Republicans. A Navy SEAL who served in combat before starting his business, the 38-year-old could pose a serious threat to Sen. Jon Tester, and potentially help flip control of the Senate back to the GOP.  


But fresh information has emerged that undercuts Sheehy’s story of self-made scrappiness. And the details come from an unlikely source: Sheehy himself.  


In a forthcoming memoir to be released this month, titled Mudslingers: A True Story of American Firefighting, Sheehy divulges the hard work and determination that went into building Bridger Aerospace. But he also details the extensive financial support from his family that made its success possible.",0.98

Crowds at a ‘redneck Christmas parade’ come up with one solution for their troubles: Trump,"> Jane Temple said she couldn’t wait for the general election for Trump to get back in and fix the economy. “We’re counting on him,” she said. “I think he cares. I may be wrong, but I think he does.” She said Trump wasn’t perfect but added, “For the most part, when he was in office, even with everything going on, he accomplished a lot.” As for Biden, Temple said: “I don’t think that he has a clue.”

> William Thompson owns a convenience store in the area. Working there, he’d seen a lot of people struggle with meth and fentanyl. “I blame Biden for that, too,” he said. Given the chance, he will be voting for Trump in 2024, he said, “because he’s the only president in my knowledge who’s given back to the people and helps the people.”

> “If he’s in jail, I’d vote for him,” Thompson said.

My god these people are dumb.  Why is it so hard for Republican voters to not understand how there’s naturally going to be economic effects all around the world from a global pandemic? 

And I wish the general American public would recognize how the United States is doing a lot better these days than most other countries, including G-7 countries these days.

And I highly doubt this town was thriving in the Trump years, give me a break. 

Trump repeatedly promised 4% GDP growth per year. He failed to get even close.

From his White House site:

""To get the economy back on track, President Trump has outlined a bold plan to create 25 million new American jobs in the next decade and return to 4 percent annual economic growth""

He left office with a 1.6 GDP growth from first quarter in office to last. Worst since Hoover

He left office with negative 3 million jobs compared to when he was inaugurated. First President since Hoover to lose jobs.

"Legal scholar: “Influential” Colorado Trump ballot challenge could set off chain reaction “Courts do not have to shield their eyes from the obvious facts staring them in the face,” law professor says",">Hood pointed out that if the Colorado Supreme Court reverses the lower-court ruling, and removes Trump from the state’s primary ballot, the US Supreme Court will likely take up the case and make a decision that settles the issue for the entire country.

This was a point made by one of the justices in Colorado on Wednesday, and not exactly surprising. Pretty much any lawsuit that actually succeeds in removing Trump from any ballot will almost certainly prompt SCOTUS to issue a landmark ruling that settles it for the entire nation, since it's a deeply Constitutional issue.

Lawsuits that don't succeed - 4 have failed so far, and 28 related cases are pending - are going to keep going through the appeals cycle until they get a favorable ruling. Which goes back to scenario #1.

So it's the same thing it has always been, and what Laurence Tribe and proponents of disqualification have been saying for months: it all leads to SCOTUS.

Personally, I just don't see it happening. As much as I agree that the language fits Trump to a T and understand the self-executing argument, a 6-3 SCOTUS with the likes of Alito and Thomas aren't going to allow the Republican frontrunner to be disqualified mid-way through a primary cycle on a Civil War provision that has scant use in 150 years, and never against a Presidential candidate. 

Further - in the minds of conservative justices, they are going to see it as disenfranchising millions of people and my top guess is that they will take the easy way out and say it doesn't apply to the Presidency. That, or they will determine some insane, impossible burden of proof is required (like conviction of an insurrection-related law code).

I'd love to be wrong, though.",0.97

*     Arizona
*     DC (likely Jack Smith but there's no confirmation yet)

The prior policy since LBJ that Israel does not have to withdraw to 1967 borders like the United Nations asked if there are more defensible borders has caused many problems because there is no process for determining what those alternate borders are.

What is authoritarianism? It’s thrown around a lot in politics. Here’s what it means,"- Politicizing independent institutions: Taking over independent, non-partisan functions and installing loyalists instead.  **(Project 2025)**

- Spreading disinformation: Using constant lies and misinformation to control narratives, demonize enemies and instill mistrust in government and judicial policies. **(Trump, GOP, Fox News, OAN etc.)**

- Aggrandizing executive power: Surrounding themselves with people loyal to them, rather than to the country, passing laws to gain more power and less oversight, taking control of legislatures and courts. **(Trump)**

- Quashing dissent: Silencing opposition, citizen protests and independent journalism, using the power of the state to quiet opposition or resistance. Referring to opponents as enemies. **(Trump and MAGA)**

- Marginalizing vulnerable communities: ""Many authoritarians attack vulnerable groups intentionally,"" ProtectDemocracy said, ""sowing division and attempting to turn the many against the few."" Authoritarians will often refer to marginalized people in less-than-human terms. **(Alt-Right, Proud Boys, GOP, Trump)**

- Corrupting elections: Authoritarians may pretend to honor democratic elections while changing the rules, suppressing votes, or overturning or even ignoring the actual results. **(GOP, Trump).**

- Stoking violence: Authoritarians may look the other way from political violence in their favor, ProtectDemocracy said, or may actively inflame it to ""stoke fear, division, and feelings of insecurity."" **(GOP, Trump. MAGA)**",0.7

How an Ohio senator’s stunt proves the Trump dictatorship theory,"Snatched from behind the paywall;

> Sen. J.D. Vance wants Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate my colleague Robert Kagan for allegedly inciting insurrection with his recent essay warning of the “increasingly inevitable” dangers of dictatorship under Donald Trump.

> For good measure, the Ohio Republican wants Secretary of State Antony Blinken to look into whether Kagan’s wife, Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland, should have her security clearance revoked because her “close relationship with her husband might compromise her judgment about the best interests of the United States.”

> Robert Kagan: A Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable.

> Right. The little woman, who was George W. Bush’s ambassador to NATO and has decades of foreign policy experience in both Republican and Democratic administrations, must be under her husband’s thumb.

> Under ordinary circumstances — that is to say, circumstances in which Trump’s reelection were not a serious possibility — Vance’s missive would be dismissible for what it is: a preening, Trump-toadying stunt. No sane Justice Department would take any action other than tossing Vance’s letter in the trash. No sane State Department would touch Nuland’s clearance.

> In the current climate, however, the stunt must be taken seriously as a preview of what life under a Trump presidency — or, to use Kagan’s term, a Trump dictatorship — might entail. Because we know, not from Kagan but from Trump himself, along with his constitutionally illiterate enablers, that this is just the kind of abuse of power they contemplate in a second Trump term.

> If you missed it, please read Kagan’s anguished plea, and his follow-up essay this week, about the need for the country to confront the clear and present danger to democracy. Vance seized on a few sentences about what resistance to Trump overreach might entail. “Resistance could come from the governors of predominantly Democratic states such as California and New York through a form of nullification,” Kagan observed. “States with Democratic governors and statehouses could refuse to recognize the authority of a tyrannical federal government.”

> Kagan then predicted this would not happen, noting that “not even the bluest states are monolithic, and Democratic governors are likely to find themselves under siege on their home turf if they try to become bastions of resistance to Trump’s tyranny.”

> Vance, of course, omitted this caveat in his letter to Garland and Blinken. A graduate of Yale Law School, he also omitted any actual understanding of the Constitution, including the importance of free speech and a free press.

> Instead, Vance used his argument to make what I’m sure he thought was a clever point about the Justice Department’s supposed overreach in charging Trump with trying to overturn the 2020 election. The headline on his office’s accompanying press release said it all: “Senator Vance slams left-wing journalist for encouraging insurrection against potential Trump administration.”

> Oh, please. Maybe try Wikipedia? The first sentence of Kagan’s entry describes my colleague as “an American neoconservative scholar.” He has also, among other roles, been foreign policy adviser to Republican congressman Jack Kemp, a speechwriter for Reagan secretary of state George P. Shultz and a foreign policy adviser to John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign. Kagan backed the U.S. war in Iraq. Some left-winger.

> Yet that was just the start of Vance’s sophistry. “I suspect that one or both of you might characterize this article as an invitation to ‘insurrection,’ a manifestation of criminal ‘conspiracy,’ or an attempt to bring about civil war,” the letter states, mischaracterizing Kagan’s essay as arguing that “a second Trump presidency would justify secession, treason, and (likely) political violence.” That is not even close to a fair reading.

> But then Vance gets to his real point. “As you know, prosecutors in the Department of Justice have embraced several stunningly broad interpretations of federal law in their bid to ensnare President Trump in criminal wrongdoing,” he writes. “For example, prosecutors have relied on a broad reading of 18 U.S.C. § 241 to argue that President Trump has conspired to ‘threaten’ or ‘intimidate’ one or more persons in their free exercise of the ‘right to vote, and to have one’s vote counted.’ By that standard, I would like to know whether a supporter of President Trump might be ‘intimidate[d]’ into foregoing the right to vote after learning that Robert Kagan has encouraged large blue states to rebel against the United States if Trump is elected. If so, I wonder further whether the editors of The Washington Post, having put Kagan’s call to arms in print, might have conspired to suppress the vote.”

> So, this is the Vance analogy, such as it is: a defeated candidate accused of pressuring state officials to subvert election results, scheming to submit slates of false electors, and strong-arming his vice president to refrain from performing his constitutionally prescribed role — this person is on a par with a historian and opinion columnist, and the institution that publishes him, performing their constitutionally protected roles.

> As I said, not worth denouncing — until now. Trump’s mouthpieces have not been coy about their disdain for the First Amendment and their zeal to use the levers of executive power to punish perceived enemies in the media.

> Witness former Trump administration official Kash Patel, who warned on Steve Bannon’s podcast, “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”

> And witness Trump himself, declining Sean Hannity’s invitation to disclaim, as the Fox News host put it, “any plans whatsoever if reelected president to abuse power, to break the law, to use the government to go after people.”

> “You mean, like they’re using right now?” Trump replied. He keeps announcing the illegal part out loud — his willingness to use the power of the presidency and the criminal justice system to wreak vengeance on his political enemies.

> Vance’s letter is a stunt, sure, but it’s not only a stunt. It’s a blueprint that proves Kagan’s point.",0.96

US blocks UN Security Council demand for humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza,"Can someone explain to me what the play is here?

US blocks UN Security Council demand for humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza,"The excuse the U.S. seems to be going with is that the U.N. security council has not condemned the Hamas attack, when the previous ceasefire resolution by Brazil explicitly condemned it as an unjustifiable criminal terrorist attack and was still vetoed by the U.S.

The additional excuse the U.S. appears to be going with is that a ceasefire would 'only benefit Hamas'. When 80% of the civilian population is displaced the primary beneficiary of humanitarian ceasefire is not one of the combatants but the civilians without access to basic supplies which the combatants are obligated to provide but failing to do so. Claiming that only one of the combatants would benefit seems to ignore the civilian population.

The other excuse seems to be that a ceasefire would somehow prevent other on the ground diplomacy from paying off. But it's not clear that the U.S. is even negotiating with anyone in Gaza for the release of the hostages, the previous hostages were released in a deal between Hamas and Israel brokered by Qatar and Israel already pulled out of further talks.

The other excuse seems to be that failing to remove Hamas militarily will sow the seeds for the next conflict. But if removing Hamas militarily requires much more civilian loss of life or Israel reoccupying Gaza and suppressing elections then this can also sow the seeds for the next conflict with a new batch of anti-Israel hardliners even if the military approach is initially successful.

The U.S. should play the role of a neutral arbitrator to resolve the conflict and consider abstaining rather than vetoing future calls for ceasefire, the reasons publicly stated for opposing it thus far do not really seem adequate.",0.78

Charter school enrollment is way down (KIPP in SoCal is closing a bunch of campuses because they don’t have students). I work for a different charter system now and our low attendance is unsustainable for much longer.

Private school enrollment is a bit harder to track but they seem to be declining as well; several in my area have closed and the others are slamming me with ads to get my kids to go.

Where the hell are all the kids? I suspect there are literally tens of thousands just in my state that quit school in 2020 and never came back. The state is not doing enough to track them. 

I can also tell you from my experience I know several students that are enrolled at my school, but have never come. I have personally called and spoken to their parents, and they have told me they just don’t want their kids going. And yes, proper authorities have been informed.

"Biden wants to give 500,000 Americans money to buy homes","As much as I would appreciate this, it doesn’t actually solve the problem. 

Houses are being bought up at a ridiculously fast pace by big corporations who are owned by Blackrock or Vangaurd in 90% of cases. They then turn around, slap a cheap coat of paint on the old property, throw in some vinyl floors overtop of the nice hardwood (because it would be too expensive to actually renovate) and then rent the house for 2-4x their mortgage price to people like me, who would have normally been a prospective home owner in any other generation. 

Our options are rent or die. And the value of the property continues to go up and make the rich people who own stock in these companies richer. 

It needs to be made illegal for these operations to exist. **No corporation should be legally allowed to own single-family housing. Their only priority is making money for their shareholders and they don’t give a single fuck about the American consumer. They are taking advantage of housing, one of the most fundamental needs for every person.**",0.96
"Biden wants to give 500,000 Americans money to buy homes","Best thing we could do is pass national legislation forbidding investments in single-family homes.

Stop corporations from buying massive amount of homes and turning them into rentals.

Get lumber prices back down to pre covid levels

This one is just mine but maybe give sellers 6% when they sell their home to cover realtor fees.  

Get interest rates back down to the 5% level.   I'm not asking for the covid 2.5% level.  That clearly wasn't good for the economy because that started the home price craze.",0.96

RANT: I dont get americans, whatever you can say about Clinton ur economy grow about 3.8% then u go for the dumb Bush and Obama did good after the crisis and u go for the ever dumer Trump. I mean if a goverment did a 3.8% here they would not loose to, sorry to say, small topics in the greatest picture of gavernance like abortion, LGBTQ and even smaller War on Chistmas or whatever stupid cultural war.

Its like a lot of americans are willing to burn the economy, their wallets and their rights for such small things, that in any way, shape or form affect their income, a smoke screen to obfuscate the advantages given to the wealthy and coorporations in their detriment. 

Unlike you guys, in our independence the Catholic Church was the 4° Power, and it took a lot of time to separate from it, and some are still trying, for some reason a lot of your citizens want to go that way ... probably cause you tend to look only at your bellybutton, specially while learning history outside the US.

Dont get me wrong or politicians, institusions and public searvants are a million time more corrupt, in ways the US have not experience for the last,say 100 years give or take or never have at our level I may say...eg Watergate is a any given Monday. There is one thing I respect the US for ... is the ONLY HUGE COUNTRY (size and heterogeneous  population) that, to this day, has never devolve into a Dictatorship like ours, were the State sanction terrosism against their citizens in some places even to this day (eg. past dictatorships like Chile, Argentina, Brazil etc)  ... and an authoritarian US frighten me cause I dont want more military dictatorships or authoritarian goverments back by the US goverment as the US did on the past 😱

Home builders?

I live in an area where all properties are public information, so there are also many cases where corporations will be used for privacy reasons to conceal the owners of a home (eg 1234 First St LLC owns the house at that address legally). Are you against that?

How do you handle foreclosures on a mortgage - is the lending corporation no longer able to foreclose because they’re never allowed to own it?

I’m not against this, mind you, it’s just not as simple as banning all corporations.

Trump Isn’t Bluffing,It truly is the playbook of the planet's most reviled dictators. Americans with pretensions of loving their country who nevertheless supports this terrible human being are completely inexcusable.,0.94
Trump Isn’t Bluffing,"Americans have become inured to Donald Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric, but his message has grown darker and more authoritarian. Going into 2024, people need to recognize that he isn’t bluffing, David A. Graham argues. 

“In the past few months, the former president has described himself as a ‘very proud election denier.’ He has repeatedly threatened and intimidated judges, witnesses, prosecutors, and even the family of prosecutors involved in the cases against him, going so far as to say that his legal opponents will be consigned to mental asylums if he’s reelected. He has suggested that the man he picked for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff deserves to be executed on grounds of treason. He’s called for investigating NBC and possibly yanking the network off the air, also on grounds of treason—one of his most direct attacks on the First Amendment. And he’s vowed to arrest and indict President Joe Biden and other political opponents for no apparent reason other than that they oppose him. 

“When a second-term President Trump directs the Justice Department to lock up Democratic politicians or generals or reporters or activists on flimsy or no grounds at all, people will wring their hands, but they’ll also shrug and wonder why he didn’t do it sooner,” Graham writes. “After all, he’s been promising to do it forever, right?”

"There’s plenty of hypocrisy with Moms for Liberty, other pious GOP frauds | Politically, Moms for Liberty has done the Republicans more harm than good by banning books, attacking teachers and librarians, and picking on LGBTQ students.","Selected excerpts...

>It’s gotten to where it’s almost axiomatic in American politics: Show me somebody who gets TV face-time railing against others’ sexual sins, and I’ll show you somebody hiding naughty secrets. 
>
>The latest example is an amusing scandal involving Moms for Liberty, the Florida-based right-wing organization that made its name by publicizing what this column described as “the preposterous idea that the nation’s public-school librarians and grade-school teachers are plotting the sexual subversion of small children.”
>
>One correspondent framed the new scandal this way: “Newest children’s title approved for Florida school libraries: ‘Bridget’s Totally Non-Gay Three-Way.”’ 
>
>Cruel, but funny.
>
>The Bridget in question is Bridget Ziegler, the Sarasota spokesmodel and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, and her husband, Christian Ziegler. Among other things, Mrs. Ziegler is credited with helping inspire Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” law forbidding teachers from mentioning the existence of homosexuality.
>
>See, it turns out that husband Christian stands accused of raping the woman with whom he and Bridget had been sharing sexual liaisons. 
>
>Sarasota police released a heavily redacted investigative report containing the words “raped” and “sexually battered.” The allegation is that Christian Ziegler, the elected chairman of Florida’s Republican Party, showed up at the alleged victim’s place seeking a more traditional two-way adulterous encounter.
>
>According to an affidavit obtained by the Florida Center for Government Accountability, and reported by Lucian K. Truscott IV, the woman demurred, explaining, “Sorry, I was mostly in (it) for her.” She says Ziegler proceeded to take her by force. 
>
>Almost needless to say, the Zieglers are also big Trump allies. Because nothing enhances one’s credibility with right-wing Christians like being strong with the old p—y-grabber.
>
>Bridget Ziegler has also admitted a sexual encounter involving her, her husband and his accuser, but says it only happened the one time.
>
>Politically, Moms for Liberty has done the Republicans more harm than good anyway. Banning books, attacking teachers and librarians, and picking on vulnerable LGBTQ students has turned out to be less popular among voters than many imagined it would be. Recent school board and state legislative elections, in Pennsylvania and Virginia in particular, resulted in candidates associated with the group losing pretty much across the board. It appears that voters aren’t happy about being told their local schools are run by perverts and subversives.

Seven delusions plaguing the mind of the Trump base voter,"1. Deceptive RationalizationWhatever Trump says or does, no matter the evidence to the contrary, his loyal followers normalize, downplay, excuse, and rationalize his behaviors, speech, and legal issues.

2. Respect for the strong-man imageAmerican masculinity is under attack. Trump appeals to the MAGA mindset by exemplifying the 20th-century fighting persona of great American manhood. To his fans, he is John Wayne or Rocky Balboa, someone who takes no crap and fights to the end.

3. Biden is much worse than TrumpWhen I discussed Trump’s dictatorial language with Trump-voting friends, one said, “Biden is not an option.” Another remarked, “I’ll take Trump any day over Biden. He is better than what we have now.”

4. WhataboutismComparing Trump to Biden and his son Hunter is a favorite MAGA mind game. For every controversial Trump action, there is a Biden equivalent that evens the playing field.

5. Rural/blue-collar America gives its middle finger to governmental authorityFor Trump’s supporters, he personifies turning the tables on authority with a “stick it to the boss” mentality. Ironically, Trump vows to replace authority with more authority, loyal only to him.

6. Trump represents an America First policy agenda that gets things done.In Iowa last week, as before, Trump bragged, “I kept Israel safe. I kept Ukraine safe. None of this stuff would have happened. And I kept the entire world safe….And as the 47th president…we will do it again.” And the crowds cheer wildly.

7. Us-versus-Them mentality“We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections,” Trump said on Nov. 11 in New Hampshire.",0.92

* 40,000+ injured as in missing limbs not just bruises and scratches 
* 170,000 homes damaged as in partially destroyed (imagine the side of your house gone, basically inhabitable)
* 62,000 homes demolished 
* 1,800,000 people displaced under threat of death 
* complete lack of any civil infrastructure due to Israel targeting anything from power houses to water plants. So even if Palestinians did get a chance to come back they would love in rubbles without any water or electricity, during dead of winter.

The government has removed on-campus polling locations for universities.

"Column: In two decades, much of the West has turned blue. Why hasn’t Texas?","In a word, *corruption*.",0.94
"Column: In two decades, much of the West has turned blue. Why hasn’t Texas?","Lots of snark from folks that aren't from Texas here... not that it's not warranted, but it's also not really accurate. Oil/gas/mineral rights on land, for example, typically go to the state unless you are either very rich (e.g. investors, oil/gas companies) or have had the land in your family for a very long time.  


Look... voter suppression is a *thing* in Texas; you really can't discount its impact. I'm not just talking about the bewildering packing and cracking of the urban centers, either, or the reduction of voting locations in *certain* locations. Texas' GOP state legislature actively and aggressively undermines the will of non-Republican voters and/or other branches of government. A few examples:

&#x200B;

* Ability of state now to potentially overturn lawful election results in Houston
* A ban on fracking near schools and residences in north Texas was banned by the state lege.
* A ban on single-use plastic bags in Austin was banned by the state lege (they are fans of ""ban the ban"")
* The state sending state troopers to police areas that voted for local police accountability.
* This whole current abortion fracas with Ken Paxton
* shit... the fact that Ken Paxton is even still in office....

&#x200B;

...anyway, you probably get the point. The message for decades has been extremely loud and clear: your vote does not mean shit, if what you vote for is against the designs of the GOP. 

Yes, if enough people turned out to vote, then statewide elections could yield surprising results, but that's just voter suppression 101 — to demoralize your opposition from even voting at all. It's incredibly dispiriting to see all of your efforts not just ignored, but pushed aside with sneering malice.

This boils down to it really, sorry you don't want to hear it. You need to adapt your policy to red states reality too.

You need texan support too, from people who live there, you cannot run that one externally from DC. It's too far away, they resent it, it's not the same poverty conditions and it generally doesn't work. The GOP has the support of the people on the fence living in texas proper which is really who you need.

Beto well shot his carreer with the ""taking your guns"" line and tripling down on it (like -20% support in texas) and now it's Abbot instead. Running for ""out of state support"" doesn't really work in texas, imho; you need to campaign with the texans themselves.

Edit they don't even like trump or the magas, imho. They just hate anti-2A dems more, and see them as a threath to their livehood. And without possibly ranked choice voting, there's only 2 party lines on the table really, so.

Furthermore what works in DC doesn't necessarily work in the rural outback-like corners. it's maybe closer to the Mojave in term of standards (tho without the water policy i guess). The second you step out of Austin or Dallas, different country.

edit let me be blunt : external gun laws from DC is what got them to ignore you. Attempting to go against it openly is how you'd get a civil war or infighting with the makeshift confederacy.

"Column: In two decades, much of the West has turned blue. Why hasn’t Texas?","Two big reasons

First, the Texas Democratic party has just been absolute shit for the past decade or so. The people at the top are only focused on consolidating and maintaining their power rather than actually improving the party. When you compare the internal infrastructure, communication network, etc between the Texas Rep and Dem parties, the disparities you'll come across are mindnumbing. The Dem party doesn't even have the basics like Precinct chairs. And if someone does want to fulfill that role they get zero training or assistance from the party. The GOP on the other hand is highly active when it comes to precinct chairs. 

On top of it all, party leaders are stuck in this old defeatist mentality of we won't succeed because the GOP controls too many votes and power, so there's no point in trying. Personally I think they hide behind this as a way to avoid taking any blame or criticism.

Second Dem candidates push way too hard on anti 2A stances. Usually it's to appease outside entities or forces, but that message resonates horribly in Texas. It's simply too polarizing of an issue in Texas. Especially if a candidate is touting the national liberal stance of banning certain types of guns, stricter regulations, national  registry, and such. Not saying candidates can't advocate for gun reform but they'll have to walk a very fine line of placating voters  on both sides.",0.94

‘Very Stressful': Ukraine Allies Watch In Frustration As Congress Dithers Over Aid,"Excerpts:

If American aid lapses, Ukrainians will see it as a repudiation of the 1994 agreement called the Budapest Memorandum, signed by the U.S., Russia and Britain, that they say guaranteed Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for giving up what was then the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, which it inherited from the Soviet Union. While most Americans have forgotten or never knew of the agreement, that is not the case for Ukrainians and their allies.

“A cynic would believe that Republicans have made this immigration demand because they want Ukraine funding to go down,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been negotiating with Sen. Jim Lankford (R-Okla.) on immigration.

Despite those numbers, Ukraine aid has been subject to far more scrutiny and conditions. For example, in October, Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) issued a 14-page “white paper” on the war in Ukraine that included a list of a dozen questions and demands he said needed to be addressed before more military aid to Ukraine should be approved.  
  
In addition to questions about how long the war was expected to take, its likely price tag and “exit criteria,” Garcia included one other: “President Biden must provide a commitment and evidence to the fact that his administration is not jeopardizing the schedule and cost of critical domestic weapon programs or the commitments we have made to Taiwan \[Foreign Military Sales\] programs and Israel \[Foreign Military Financing\] programs.”  
  
In other words, the U.S. could provide more aid, but only if that would not hurt the flow of arms supplies to Israel and Taiwan.",0.95

Biden administration asserts power to seize drug patents in move to slash high prices,"Obviously drug prices in the US are exorbitant. However, let’s understand what this will do, since it seems like it only applies to molecules that used federal funding in development. The article states that the federal government has provided tens of billions over the last decade to drug development. This is a drop in the bucket for pharmaceutical companies. Ultimately to protect their patents, they just won’t take that tiny bit of development money and then this won’t apply. They will also tend to avoid drugs that are developed in academic settings with public money, particularly for more rare conditions which have the highest drug prices. This may have an impact now on the drugs currently available, but realistically all of this will get tied up in court for a long while on a case-by-case basis, so I wouldn’t expect a massive shift any time soon.",0.98

A drug company then licenses that patent from the university and spends the next 5 to 10 years (and tons of its own money) developing and obtaining FDA approval for a drug.  Along the way it’s not unusual for the drug company to obtain additional patents of its own (without use of federal funds) covering the pharmaceutical formulation and manufacturing of the marketed drug.  Even if the government were to seek March-in Rights for the initial basic patent that was licensed from a university, that won’t give them any right to use any of the company’s subsequent patents on pharmaceutics and manufacturing of the actual marketed drug.

"‘We can’t start our healing journey’: Maine shooting survivors, families demand investigation in Washington","From [Globe.com](http://globe.com)

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Alan Nickerson leaned toward US Senator Angus King of Maine in the packed hallway. “That’s the Senate floor?” he asked. It was, King confirmed, pointing out the view of the US Supreme Court on the other end of the hallway.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t a formal tour, but Nickerson — who survived the shooting rampage that left [18 dead ](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/27/metro/maine-shooting-victims/#seal?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)in Lewiston, Maine, on Oct. 25 — and relatives of victims who died were getting one anyway.

&#x200B;

Nickerson and the group he was with — a heartbreaking club including widows (one wearing a “Lewiston Strong” sweatshirt) and parents grieving their dead children — were in Washington Thursday to meet with the four members of their state’s congressional delegation and with White House officials. They were the latest group of shooting survivors to come to Washington seeking answers and solutions.

And, critically, they were there to demand an independent investigation into why preventive action was not taken before the shooting.

&#x200B;

“If it can’t be prevented in this case given all that was known about this individual, given that he had threatened to commit a mass shooting and that that had gone up the chain of command in his Army reserve unit, if it can’t be stopped here, it can’t be stopped anywhere,” said Benjamin Gideon, one of the attorneys representing the group.

The shootings at Just-in-Time Recreation and Schemengees Bar & Grill were horrific, but all the more so given how many flags about the possibility of a threat were raised before the violence.

&#x200B;

“We can’t start our healing journey until we have all the information,” signed Elizabeth Seal — the wife of [Joshua Seal](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/09/metro/maine-shooting-joshua-seal-funeral/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), 34, who was killed playing cornhole at Schemengees — at a press conference later in the day.

&#x200B;

Elizabeth Seal, who is deaf, said through an ASL interpreter that the deaf community experienced delays in communication the day of the shooting. She called for more inclusive practices in emergency situations, such as cameras keeping a wide shot so ASL interpreters can stay on-screen for viewers.

But the group was largely focused on calling for an investigation, given the red flags raised about the gunman before the shooting. Robert R. Card II, was a first sergeant in the US Army Reserve when he committed the worst mass shooting in Maine’s history. He later died by suicide.

&#x200B;

Local police and military officials [were aware that the gunman was “armed and dangerous”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/01/metro/maine-shooting-texts/?p1=Article_Inline_Related_Box&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) more than a month before the attacks, and sheriff’s deputies had been dispatched to his home nearby in Bowdoin more than once to perform wellness checks after warnings from his colleagues in the military and his family.

&#x200B;

Legal experts, including an architect of Maine’s “yellow flag” law, have said local law enforcement[ seem to have had enough information](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/02/metro/maine-authorities-could-have-moved-seize-gunmans-firearms-before-shootings-experts-say/?p1=StaffPage&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to take him into custody and begin the process of seizing his guns before the shootings took place.",0.95

Texas judge allows Kate Cox to abort fetus with lethal abnormality,"For the first time in at least 50 years, a judge has intervened to allow an adult Texas woman to terminate her pregnancy.  


When Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble handed down the temporary restraining order Thursday, Kate Cox, 31, of Dallas burst into tears. Cox and her husband desperately wanted to have this baby, but her doctors said continuing the nonviable pregnancy posed a risk to her health and future fertility, according to a historic lawsuit filed Tuesday.  


The Texas Office of the Attorney General, which challenged Cox’s claims at Thursday’s hearing, may try to ask a higher court to intervene.  


At 20 weeks pregnant, Cox learned her fetus had full trisomy 18, a chromosomal abnormality that is almost always fatal before birth or soon after. Before the overturn of Roe v. Wade, Texas law allowed doctors to terminate pregnancies due to lethal fetal anomalies at any point during the pregnancy. But now, Cox’s doctors said their hands were tied by Texas’ abortion laws, which prohibit abortion except to save the life of the pregnant patient.  


A week after she first received the diagnosis, Cox and her husband, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, filed a lawsuit asking a judge to grant a temporary restraining order, allowing them to terminate this pregnancy.  


After a 45 minute Zoom hearing Thursday, Gamble ruled that Cox should be allowed to terminate the pregnancy, and that Dr. Damla Karsan, a Houston OB/GYN, should be protected from civil and criminal penalties if she performs the procedure.  


The state cannot directly appeal Thursday’s order, since it is a temporary restraining order. Instead, the Office of the Attorney General would have to file a writ of mandamus petition, asking a higher court to take the extraordinary measure of overturning the emergency order.",0.98

The gall of these people. Openly acknowledging they're forcing mothers to go through an entire pregnancy and a grim parody of childbirth just so they can watch their babies die in pain minutes to hours after birth.

I would do anything for my 11 month old son. The moment I held him for the first time was one of the greatest moments in my life. But if a doctor told me that he was going to be born missing key parts of his body, guaranteed to die in misery without even having context for his momentary existence in this world, I would have been 100% on board with an abortion.

Texas judge allows Kate Cox to abort fetus with lethal abnormality,"A late friend of mine lost her fetus at 7 months. The child aborted because of severe fetal defect. It was not pretty. She almost died then herself because she hemorrhaged so badly. 

She would actually die a few months later because despite all the care she received in the hospital they missed an aneurysm just shattering the life of her husband who had already been through the miscarriage and trouble conceiving with her. 

She was 34 years old and after she died he chose to become a Buddhist monk and retreat to a monastery rather than live in the world without her and their child. He'd been on that track before they even met but her death and losing that child it just crushed him. 

These religious conservatives with their anti woman agendas they're messing with people's lives and potentially killing people over their religious beliefs when really it has nothing to do with people who do not follow that. 

I am so glad that I'm now past early menopause and live in a more progressive state. I was never personally much for abortion as birth control but that's a very personal choice and I would fucking abandon Texas or anywhere else long before I'd let some stupid law like that prevent me from having a choice.

I would love to see every woman in the state just pack up and leave in protest, seriously. Then see how well that state functions without them. I bet those stupid laws would change real quick the minute the straight, mostly white, ultra conservative men of Texas realized they were not going to be getting laid any time soon! Then again they're probably so dense it would take a year after they left for them to figure it out. 

I'm sorry but NO my personal autonomy when it comes to my body and my health care isn't for anyone to decide especially when all that is based on a religion that isn't even mine and never will be.

Colorado justices grapple with unprecedented possibility of disqualifying Trump from ballot,"""Members of the Colorado Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared hesitant to be the first in the nation to declare Donald Trump ineligible to appear on next year's ballot under a constitutional provision generally barring insurrectionists from holding office.  
At the same time, the justices were critical of Trump's arguments for keeping him on the ballot, including that the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol did not qualify as an ""insurrection.""

""Why isn’t it enough that a violent mob breached the Capitol when Congress was performing a core constitutional function? In some ways, that seems like a poster child for insurrection,"" said Justice William W. Hood III.""

The Texas Historical Commission Removed Books on Slavery From Plantation Gift Shops,">After visiting the Varner-Hogg plantation an hour south of Houston, amateur historian Michelle Haas was incensed by what she had seen. At an exhibit that details the farm’s use as a sugar plantation worked by at least 66 slaves in the early nineteenth century, she’d watched an informational video. To her mind, it focused too much on slavery at the site and not enough on the Hogg family, which had turned its former home into a museum celebrating Texas history. 

Won't someone please think of the Slavers!

>Haas, a graphic designer from Corpus Christi who sells Texas-themed merchandise, has spent years critiquing historical narratives about slavery. In 2006, she cofounded Copano Bay Press, an independent publishing house specializing in firsthand accounts of Texas history. She wrote and published 200 Years a Fraud, a full annotation of Solomon Northup’s 1853 memoir Twelve Years a Slave, which was made into an Oscar-winning film in 2013. In her book, Haas disputes Northup’s account of his life and argues that many U.S. histories are overly harsh to the South and do not acknowledge that slavery was “a socially acceptable and economically worthwhile practice worldwide at the time our thirteen colonies arose.” 

Slavery wasn't bad?

>In 2022, Haas launched the Texas History Trust, a nonprofit advocacy organization that aims to fight back against what it describes as “historical societies, university history departments and authors who warp Texas history based on feelings, not the historical record.”

Ah yes, Facts over Feelings. 

>Haas also criticized the Varner-Hogg museum for not focusing enough on slaves who had perpetrated violence against each other at the behest of their slavers. “Several of the static exhibits at Varner detail the torture inflicted upon the enslaved people who labored there but omit the fact that the chief torturer was one of the slaves,” Haas wrote.

Even Biden has let slip that he is running because 'has to' and people on the left are convinced that they have no choice if they want to 'save democracy'.  

With Biden's low poll numbers, running against Biden is his best chance at actually winning, rather than the Democrats taking the 'risk' of running an objectively more appealing candidate this late in the game.

Now, while I don't personally think Trump would 'destroy democracy' and try to actually become a dictator, I fully believe he would fuck up the country even further.

US to oppose Arab-backed resolution calling for urgent Gaza ceasefire,"Because it's a disingenuous resolution.  The only way a cease fire can work is if both Hamas *and* Israel agree, and Hamas has no representation or willingness to abide by UN resolutions.  The UN calling for a ceasefire means Hamas gets to continue it's attacks while Israel does not, it just perpetuates Hamas' violence and sets Israel up to be forced to break a UN resolution in order to defend itself.

That said, there absolutely should be a ceasefire, Biden was, amazingly, able to negotiate a temporary one for hostage exchange, if the UN is willing to forego pointless grandstanding and work with the US who is currently the only country willing to try and negotiate between Hamas and Israel, maybe a longer ceasefire can happen.",0.72
US to oppose Arab-backed resolution calling for urgent Gaza ceasefire,"Summary of US stance from today's UNSC meeting press release:

>ROBERT A. WOOD (United States) noted that his country, in partnership with Qatar and Egypt, helped reunite more than 100 hostages with their loved ones and dramatically expanded aid.  “Hamas, however, has a different set of goals,” he stated, refusing to release young women hostages, while he cited the Council’s serious moral failure to condemn that group’s evil attacks on 7 October.  An undeniable reality is that if Israel unilaterally laid down its weapons, Hamas would continue to hold hostages, many of whom are being subjected to inhumane treatment.  Hamas continues to pose a threat to Israel — one that no other Member State would allow to exist on its borders.  His delegation does not support calls for an immediate ceasefire, as Hamas has no desire for peace or a two-State solution. Condemning extremist settler violence, he noted that his Government is implementing a visa restriction policy on guilty parties.",0.72

Trump’s Latest Courtroom Defeats Are a Really Big Deal,"There are indeed some immunities attached to being the President WITHIN THE CONFINES OF HIS OR HER OFFICIAL DUTIES. Noone could sue the President himself over a policy decision, no family can sue or arrest the President himself for a foreign or domestic act of war/violence. However these court rulings, if they stand, validate and establish that Presidents do not have immunity for criminal acts outside of their official duties.

As the judge perfectly states... we don't have Kings in America. Presidents do not get to rape and murder ""because they are on the clock"". Incidentally, we can partially thank President Ulysses Grant for setting this precedent when he willingly was arrested for speeding in a horse-drawn carriage in 1872.

Trump’s Latest Courtroom Defeats Are a Really Big Deal,"From reporter Greg Walters:

Former President Donald Trump has a long history of arguing that he can’t be held legally accountable for the outrageous, rule-bending things he does because he was the president—an argument that has often sounded like an attempt to declare himself above the law. 

But a pair of courts just brought him back down to Earth. Combined, they represent both a devastating loss for Trump—and a big deal for future presidents, too.

Starr and his vilely partisan team of Republican-dispatched Special Prosecutors were nothing more than a multi-year clown show of both investigative bumbling and legal incompetence. I refuse to believe that *anyone* on his team now has *any specialized knowledge or insight* on the handling of presidential investigations, *or* on court rulings involving their rights.

NRA finds surprising ally in ACLU for Supreme Court challenge to NY blacklist allegation,That is not surprising at all.  The ACLU has stood up for the KKK free speech.  The only reason conservatives could think this is surprising is because they have apparently never looked into the legislation behind free speech even though they say they are free speech abolitionist.,0.3

NRA finds surprising ally in ACLU for Supreme Court challenge to NY blacklist allegation,"Yeah, it's always been a double-edged sword with them. I have mixed feelings about it.

The ACLU, say what else you will about them, are always absolutists about protecting the ideals for which they stand. They walk their talk, every time, no matter \*who\* the hypothetical question applies to.

I'm not sure how I feel about their willingness to take up the fight for people doing evil with their rights in addition to those doing good, but I do respect that kind of consistency of ideals and resistance against forming loyalties. It's refreshing to see someone arguing in good faith, from a purely philosophical (yet honest) thought process.",0.3

“I have no conflicts,” McDonald said.

He is friends with Silver State President Steve Kalish, who threw a fund-raiser for McDonald at his bar during the councilman’s re-election campaign last year. McDonald is also friends with Silver State’s general counsel Robert Groesbeck and has dated Silver State employee Jennifer Simich.

>  WASHINGTON – A New York man was found guilty in the District of Columbia on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2023, of felony obstruction of an official proceeding and other charges related to his conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.

> Philip Sean Grillo, 49, of Queens, New York, was found guilty of five charges, including one felony, by a federal jury in Washington, D.C. Grillo was convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding, a felony, and misdemeanor offenses of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

> U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth will sentence Grillo on a date to be determined by the Court.

> According to evidence presented during the trial, on Jan. 6, 2021, Grillo was present at the front of a group of rioters facing the police line on the West Plaza of the U.S. Capitol grounds. Shortly after he was seen on the grounds, Grillo was observed illegally entering the Capitol building via a broken window near the Senate Wing door at about 2:20 p.m. carrying a megaphone. Grillo then made his way up the stairs to the Rotunda. While ascending the stairs, Grillo was interviewed by an individual inside the Capitol, who recorded the interview on video. This individual asked Grillo, “Look at me and tell me what you’re here for?” Grillo responded, “I’m here to stop the steal. It’s our F— House!” Grillo then made his way further into the Capitol.

> Grillo was then seen on surveillance video footage about 15 minutes later with a mob of rioters attempting to exit the Rotunda and gain entry to a foyer that contained doors leading outside, where more rioters were gathered. However, the rioters’ movement was prohibited by United States Capitol Police (USCP) officers attempting to stop the rioters’ progress. Eventually, the mob, including Grillo, forced their way past the officers and made their way towards the Rotunda’s exterior entryway doors. Grillo was among the first few individuals to get past the officers.

> The mob, of which Grillo was a part, then approached the Rotunda’s exterior entryway doors, which were guarded by three Capitol Police officers. Grillo and the mob eventually pushed past the officers and opened the exterior doors, allowing numerous additional  rioters inside the building. Grillo briefly went through the doors to the terrace area on the East Front of the Capitol where numerous other rioters were gathered.  Grillo made several recordings of himself on his cell phone. In one recording, Grillo stated, “We f— did it! We got to the Capitol building. We f—did it! We f— did it, baby! We f— did it, you understand? We stormed the Capitol. We shut it down! We did it! We shut the mother..!.”

> Grillo proceeded to enter and exit the Capitol three more times and can be seen in multiple instances pushing up against police officers.  In another recording from his cell phone, he can be seen smoking marijuana inside the Capitol. In this video, Grillo stated, among other things, “Our House!” He asks, “Who’s smoking grass?” and, “Can I get a hit it of that s—?” Another video depicted Grillo high-fiving other rioters after smoking marijuana inside the Capitol.

> During trial, the defendant testified that he had “no idea” Congress met inside the Capitol building, but also admitted that he is running for election to the U.S. House to represent New York’s 3rd Congressional District.

> Grillo was arrested on Feb. 23, 2021, in New York by the FBI.

> This case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section. Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.

> This case is being investigated by the FBI’s New York and Washington Field Offices. Valuable assistance was provided by the United States Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department.

> In the 35 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,230 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including more than 440 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony.

"Trump’s Proposed Cabinet Is The Stuff of Nightmares: A second Trump term would be far, far more radical than his first.","I feel like people still don’t understand how off the rails his Presidency was, and how corralled he was by those around him, because they feared LIFE IN PRISON. 

[The Divider by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/646871/the-divider-by-peter-baker-and-susan-glasser/) goes into it, but remember that one of his own senior staff (Miles Taylor from the DHS) wrote [A Warning](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/anonymous/a-warning/9781538719497/?lens=twelve), based on his article in the NYT, illuminating a series of policies that Trump was trying to implement, despite his staff’s constant admonishments to stay within the law. 

I get that most of the Trump base is a narcissist cult, but just in case anyone is thinking “we lived through one term, we can do it again”, please take the time to learn how close we came to full blown Hitlerism from the jump during his Presidency.

That anyone supports this violent, cruel, narcissist lunatic and follows him as an ideal to be emulated is proof positive that we as a species are nowhere near the zip code of “rational”, and the fact that this trope is playing out across the globe in fire and blood from Gaza to Sudan to Myanmar, to Ukraine/Russia, to Argentina, hell, Marie La Pen almost won in FRANCE. 

Everything is ego and violence, and cruelty and destruction, and if we can’t oppose the obvious fascist uprising of the GOP - among other things - because we cling to our romantic notions of “the goodness of people” or the emotional refusal to recognize the truth about how terrible we are, we’re dead. All of us.

Miller has been floated for attorney general, while Trump is considering Bannon, who currently hosts a podcast that regularly traffics in white nationalism, as chief of staff. Kash Patel, a former member of the Trump administration and a current Trump adviser, could return for a top national security position.

3. Before saying that it's not anti-semitic to oppose Israel's existence, consider whether it would be bigoted against Palestinians to say that Palestinians don't deserve self-determination and their own state.

Then there’s the issue of believing Israel does it doesn’t have the right to exist (what Zionism is) that becomes an entirely larger issue.

However, people do and say a lot of anti-semitic stuff (posting yellow stars on _Jews_ doors at NYU, for instance) and then excuse themselves with ""I wasnt being anti-semitic, I was being anti Israel""-- after they targeted JEWS.

The reasons for criticism, what one criticizes, and the obvious effects of Israel doing what your criticize them for not doing, is what makes the criticism antisemitic.

If you believe that the only people that should be bound by a cease fire between Israel and palestinians, is Israel, you're antisemitic.

Mike Johnson Says He Has to “Blur” Some of the Faces of People Who Appear in January 6 Footage So the DOJ Can’t Charge Them With Crimes,"This shouldn't be surprising, and I'm not even mad.  Like...I'm mad that J6 happened and all those people haven't been properly charged and convicted, but I'm not mad that they're taking this course of action because we shouldn't reasonably expect anything else.

They say this is about the DOJ but in reality the second statement was far more accurate.

They don't want your average person sitting at home to see someone and go ""wait, I know them!"" and then contact the DOJ/FBI/anyone else for that matter and help law enforcement act on that information, or for them to go compile information that person has on social media, combine it with unblurred J6 footage, and go after that person's employment, social circles, etc.

The follow-up quote pretty much pointed at exactly that - ""Faces are to be blurred from public viewing room footage to prevent all forms of retaliation against private citizens from any non-governmental actors. The Department of Justice already has access to raw footage from January 6, 2021.” - pretty much the most direct way he could have said ""we don't want antifascists getting people involved in January 6th fired or ostracized, the judicial system is the only thing to be levying consequences.""

You wouldn't expect an antifascist posting fascist footage to show identities of fellow antifascists or to blur fascists, so you wouldn't expect a fascist posting footage to show identities of fellow fascists or to blur antifascists.

> On the other hand, compelled disclosure of pseudonymous social media handles to a licensing officer is no small burden. It is uncontroversial that the First Amendment protects the right to speak anonymously. Cornelio v. Connecticut, 32 F.4th 160, 169–70 (2d Cir. 2022) (reiterating a speaker’s First Amendment interest in anonymity and holding that a requirement that a sex offender report all online “communication identifier[s]” burdened protected speech); see generally McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 341–43 (1995); Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 64–65 (1960). Anyone familiar with most social media platforms knows that nearly all handles are pseudonymous, at least to the extent that the poster’s identity is not immediately apparent. Requiring disclosure of handles is thus to demand that applicants effectively forfeit their right to pseudonymous speech on social media (where so much speech now takes place).

> At this stage, the State has not demonstrated that allowing church leaders to regulate their congregants’ firearms is more dangerous than allowing other property owners to do the same. It hard to see how the law advances the interests of religious organizations, as a whole, by denying them agency to choose for themselves whether to permit firearms.

Edit https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/jpmorgan-slashes-israels-4q23-gdp-growth-forecast-11-previous-quarter-2023-10-27/

You don't get to complain about made up antisemitism no, this is illegal by textbook definitions. If they go on i'm gonna officially suggest the dissolution of AIPAC as a foreign organized crime ring. They should know better than threathening to murder FBI agents to their face. Fancy cuffs still available.

edit ""silver or lead"" (""take the money or a bullet to the head"") is when a criminal try to threathen/force a policeman into taking a bribe. The obvious intent is to use it against the police later for blackmail , while threathening murder. It's an organized crime tactic especially infamous in south america.

"All of a sudden, it's no longer taboo to talk about placing conditions on the billions of dollars in US aid to Israel",Aid to all countries should be conditioned to human rights and civil liberties; this includes Israel.

"All of a sudden, it's no longer taboo to talk about placing conditions on the billions of dollars in US aid to Israel","Israel's entire use to the US is as a client state steward for the Holy Land, so religious voters can be rest assured it's controlled by ""someone they trust.""

That's it. Really. Israel's worth as a ""Holy Land"" steward is entirely dependent on the religiousness of US voters and said voters' ability to swing. It was and is still *overwhelming,* but has been in decline for decades. What's more, what's left of religion have been getting more extreme (and less swing,) we're starting to see Israel's worth erode. Also why we start seeing anti-*Israeli* protests manifest first and most commonly amongst higher education.

If not a ""Holy Land"" steward, Israel in reality sits in a geopolitically useless area of no interest to us. US strategic interests have been for decades in the Persian Gulf for oil and secondarily the Bosphorus to contain Russia.

Israel contributes nothing to either of these interests. It simply can't send its military anywhere since nobody likes it enough to ever give it access into, let alone through, their territory. And considering we don't care about any of Israel's neighbors outside the Sauds, Israel is effectively useless to us. Worse than useless, a burden.",0.88
"All of a sudden, it's no longer taboo to talk about placing conditions on the billions of dollars in US aid to Israel","Israel has gone so far beyond the pail that I would like Biden to simply point to the IDF guarding settler terrorists in the West Bank, Israel's widescale detention of children, and their actions in Gaza and declare them in violation of the Leahy Amendment, automatically barring all military aid.

We can't revive and reorganize public spaces to make them more liveable.

We can't house the homeless.

We can't improve the lot of pedestrians.

We can't urban garden, we can't make green space to reduce heat islands, we can't support mass transit to alleviate congestion.

We clearcut the land and make the same shitty disorganized developments even further out, demanding more hostile-to-humanity stroad systems.

As far as the natural world, we poison all plants other than grass and we hunt animals that dare to continue to use their living space where humanity decides it wants to lay down stakes.

America is becoming a country of YIMBYs
America is grappling with a housing crisis.
New York CNN  —  none
Public support is building for changes to zoning codes and other laws that have dominated American housing policy for decades and restricted new development.

A new Pew Charitable Trusts poll shows broad public approval for several policy initiatives that would make it easier to build new housing, especially apartments.

The poll comes amid a severe housing shortage, a loose coalition of grassroots YIMBY leaders — short for Yes in My Backyard — and bipartisan housing policy reform efforts from Utah to Vermont.

The cost of living: How have high prices for homes, childcare and cars impacted you?

“The results reflect Americans’ broad concern about housing costs,” Pew Charitable Trusts researchers said in a report.

The median home sale price in 2022 was $386,300, up 10.2% from 2021 and the highest on record, and housing construction has failed to keep up with demand. The US housing market is short some 6.5 million homes. Rents reached record highs last year, hitting $2,054, according to Redfin.

The Pew poll found strong support for policies such as legalizing accessory dwelling units, commonly known as granny flats, on single-family zoned areas; legalizing duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes; reforms to create affordable housing development near major transit; and simplifying the housing permitting process.

Efforts to expedite permitting processes gained the broadest support, with 86%, while at the lower end, 49% approved of the ideas of allowing smaller lots and homes to be built closer together.

The limits of support

Support for policies to allow more housing cut across party, region, race, income and gender lines, Pew found. The eight most popular proposals received majority support from Republicans, Democrats and independents. Nine of the 10 policy measures polled received majority support from both renters and homeowners.

Republicans and Democrats prioritized housing reform efforts for different reasons in some cases. More Republicans than Democrats identified fewer property regulations as an excellent or good reason for housing reforms, while more Democrats than Republicans chose reducing racial segregation as an excellent or good reason.

The poll, fielded in September among a sample of 5,000 US adults, is one of the largest to date on housing issues.

And there is evidence suggesting that pro-housing policies are achieving their intended effects, slowing the rocketship of housing prices.

In Minneapolis; Portland, Oregon; New Rochelle, New York; and Tysons Corner, Virginia, new zoning rules that allow more housing have helped slow rent growth, according to a study this year by Pew Charitable Trusts. Towns and cities in the same metro areas that did not reform zoning laws generally saw faster rent growth. While rents nationwide grew 31% nationwide from 2017 to 2023, rents in those four cities all grew under 5%, according to the study.

Despite the favorable polling on housing reforms, local political opposition to new housing development in single-family neighborhoods often can remain strong. People tend to be supportive of more housing in general, just as long as it’s not right next to them.

“One of the tricky parts of housing politics is that a lot of Americans sincerely believe that their city needs more housing but are then unenthusiastic about any specific housing development on their street,” said Salim Furth, a senior research fellow and director of the Urbanity project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. “A challenge for reformers is to resolve this inconsistency.”

For example, Connecticut, Arizona and New York have attempted zoning changes, but efforts have stalled amid blowback. One New York lawmaker warned of a “suburban uprising” if Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to build 800,000 new homes over a decade went through. The plan included changes to zoning laws in suburbs near rail stations.

Zoning reform

Towns, cities and states led by both Republicans and Democrats are loosening zoning laws and reforming other policies in response to the housing crisis.

Roughly 75% of land that is zoned for housing in American cities is for private, single-family homes only.

In some suburbs, zoning laws make it illegal to build apartments in nearly all residential areas. Some municipalities have also made minimum lot sizes bigger and added height requirements. This has had the effect of encouraging ever-larger single-family homes and limiting housing options, like smaller houses.

In recent years, Minneapolis, Arlington, Gainesville, Charlotte, Walla Walla, Washington, and other cities have reformed single-family zoning laws in response to the housing crisis. Oregon, California, Washington, Montana and Maine have ended them statewide.

According to an August report from George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, more than 200 housing bills were introduced this year in at least 23 states.

Trump may still be ambivalent about the spiritual argument but thrilled to hear that others believe he is God's choice. The fact that in the end the truth is unknowable suits him just fine because it leaves people free to advocate anything they choose. Trump doesn't need to reckon with his 2020 loss because he denies it even occurred. Also, by insisting that he was cheated by his opponents, Trump aligns himself with Christians who would say the 2020 vote count was hijacked by Satan's minions including Democrats, journalists, liberals and election officials.

Wyoming’s Top Court Says It’s OK To For Cops To Steal Money Obtained From Legal Drug Sales,"I am amazed at the unconstitutionality of the laws when they pertain to drugs.

We spend $4.6M per year on sniffer dogs at festivals which incorrectly detect drugs 75% of the time, who are used by the cops for illegal and perverted strip searches for anyone including female minors, and most damaging, cause the death of kids because the kids will naturally panic and swallow all their dirty pills.

And after all this, we had our Health Minister say this recently: ""Drug use and dependence are very much health issues and ones that are far better addressed through health support outside the courts and criminal justice systems,” he said.

The president has repeatedly pointed to the steps he and congressional Democrats have already taken, including allowing Medicare to negotiate certain drug prices for the first time and capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month. However, few Americans are aware of these provisions, a recent KFF poll shows.

Here’s why it would be even harder now to kill Obamacare

The measures announced Thursday, which are largely incremental, seek to counter the power and practices of big health care companies.

The Commerce and Health and Human Services departments released a proposed framework for agencies concerning the exercise of march-in rights, which enable the federal government to license drugs or inventions backed by taxpayer funds to other parties if the invention is not made accessible to the public. The proposed framework specifies for the first time that price can be a factor in determining the accessibility of a taxpayer-funded drug or other invention.

The government has never used its march-in authority, which was enabled by the Bayh-Dole Act.

“Fundamentally, we are establishing that price can now be a factor in determining when the federal government can march in to ensure that we have lower prices,” Neera Tanden, the White House domestic policy adviser, told reporters.

Certain Democratic lawmakers have pushed for greater use of march-in rights to counter high drug prices. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading proponent, praised the administration’s effort.

“President Biden is taking a critical and much-needed step to lower costs and rein in the abuses of the pharmaceutical industry, which has raked in billions of dollars by jacking up prices for drugs that taxpayers paid to develop,” she said in a statement. “Today’s announcement means that drug companies will no longer have a free pass to hike up prices for life-saving drugs that benefitted from taxpayer dollars.”

But the administration’s proposal has already drawn criticism from the pharmaceutical industry and at least one Republican senator.

“So-called ‘march-in’ authority, codified in the 1980 bipartisan Bayh-Dole Act, is intended to be a safeguard if good-faith efforts aren’t being made by a private sector partner to commercialize federally-funded research,” the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, said in a statement. “It was never intended to be a government price setting policy.”

Both PhRMA and Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, pointed to a 2002 letter in the Washington Post by former Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana and former GOP Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.

The senators wrote “the purpose of our act was to spur the interaction between public and private research so that patients would receive the benefits of innovative science sooner … Bayh-Dole did not intend that government set prices on resulting products.”

The Biden administration’s announcement could harm the development of new medicines, both PhRMA and Cassidy said.

“This kind of short-sighted decision would kill American health care innovation and deny millions of Americans future lifesaving cures and treatments,” Cassidy said in a statement.

Ensuring competition

The Biden administration also unveiled several efforts aimed at countering anticompetitive practices by big health care companies.

Some are aimed at private equity firms, which have been buying up physician practices, nursing homes and other health care providers. Officials are concerned that corporate owners are “maximizing their profits at the expense of patients’ health and safety, while increasing costs for patients and taxpayers alike,” according to the administration’s fact sheet.

The Justice Department, along with HHS and the Federal Trade Commission, will seek input on how the growing involvement of private equity and other corporations in health care is affecting Americans. The agencies will use the information to identify areas for future regulation and enforcement prioritization and will work together on various competition policy initiatives.

The three agencies will also share data to help antitrust enforcers identify companies that engage in a series of relatively small acquisitions that lead to market consolidation – known as a “roll up” strategy – that might otherwise evade review.

Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is releasing for the first time ownership data on Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Centers, as it already has for hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers and home health agencies. Making this information available helps in identifying common owners with histories of poor performance, evaluating the connection between ownership and changes in costs and outcomes and enabling analysis on how market consolidation affects consumers.

And CMS will solicit information from the public early next year about Medicare Advantage insurance plans, which now enroll about half of Medicare beneficiaries and are expected to receive more than $7 trillion from the federal government over the next decade. It’s the latest step in the agency’s effort to understand the impact of Medicare Advantage’s growing enrollment on consumers and care.",0.97

Which voters matter in presidential elections? The ranks are shrinking.,">If U.S. presidents were selected through the principle of “one person, one vote” that governs legislative races, the ballots of undecided swing-state citizens such as Monk would be worth just as much as the other 150 million or so Americans who are expected to vote next year.
>
>But that is not the system handed down from the nation’s founding fathers, who opted for multiple winner-take-all contests that give greater power to smaller states. The electoral college was supposed to moderate the passions of what Alexander Hamilton called the “general mass,” which he worried could fall prey to candidates with “talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity.”
>
>That 18th-century system — which is unlike anything used by the United States’ 21st-century democratic peers — has aged in surprising ways. Premised on the idea that states should each choose electors who would then select a president, the system increasingly distorts the democratic process as partisan divisions grow along geographic lines.
>
>...
>
>During the last election, just 10 states and two congressional districts were targeted by Republican or Democratic nominees’ campaigns. It was a precipitous drop from the 26 states on average that were targeted each year between 1952 and 1980, according to a forthcoming book by political scientists Daron R. Shaw, Scott Althaus and Costas Panagopoulos. The research is based on internal campaign documents, interviews with campaign leaders and media reports.
>
>The Washington Post’s analysis found that just 1 in 4 Americans lived in such areas in 2020, down from roughly 3 in 4 in the earlier period. If the major parties do not contest Florida in 2024, as is widely expected, only 18 percent of Americans would live in battlegrounds.
>
>The targeted voters in the decisive states should expect a barrage of communications — on their phones, in their mail, from their friends, family and colleagues, over radio, television, streaming services and social media networks. The rest of the country’s citizens will find themselves on the sidelines, watching the news or the occasional live candidate event with a diminished voice in their own futures. Their vote will still count but is unlikely to decide anything.
>
>“It’s now getting to the point where you are probably talking about 400,000 people in three or four states. That is what it is getting down to,” said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns since 1980. “It does mean that more and more people feel that they don’t have a say.”

This system desperately needs reform. As it's applied today, it's resulting in a government and political system that's more about winning than about governing. Further, the disenfranchisement that the majority of Americans feel means that it's easier than ever to further distort representation by suppressing their willingness to vote.",0.78

AOC gloriously shuts down legislation targeting trans women in sports,"My favorite takedown of the whole sports problem is this:

If you feel that trans women should compete in men's sports, because them competing against women would be unfair, then by extension, you are also saying that trans MEN should compete in WOMEN's sports.

Now you tell me, why isn't it unfair that trans men, who are TAKING TESTOSTERONE DAILY, are competing against women who aren't doing that? How do you square that circle?

The answer is you don't, because you don't actually give a shit about women's sports, you're just a transphobic hypocrite looking for any reason to be an asshole to trans people (and women in general).",0.83

Guess we didn't get enough of this with ""Black people are better at sports because I'm a racist and think they're basically gorillas"" while that was in vogue.

If you cannot play sports bc you carry inherent biological advantages with you after you transition, and you need to sacrifice your athletic career to be true to yourself, that sucks, but nobody ever said you get everything you want in life, and it is not bigoted to say that, you silly people. It's the only principled, fair choice to make.

AOC gloriously shuts down legislation targeting trans women in sports,"I thought this had pretty much been a settled issue at least in rational circles.

If a female athlete is trans, that is only relevant if it's a sport where strength (or some other aspect where males have a large biological advantage) is a factor. And even then that would only matter for transwomen who transitioned later in life and still went through male puberty.

It's a shame this has become, and still is so politicized to try and win votes, having no respect for the dignity or humanity of the transwomen they are using as pawns to further their own political agendas and careers.

It should be being settled by medical professionals, not politicians. Same as climate change should be being settled by scientists.",0.83

There are way too many specifics to fairly rule and allow on transgender players in women’s leagues.

At any time, many Americans may know the name of the New York mayor while not even knowing the name of the mayor of *their own* town. The NYC mayor is a celebrity in a way that mayors of other cities are not. That mayorship was the whole platform from which Rudy Giuliani expected to run for president.

Because of that, the media followed him and shoved him in our faces. Eric Adams was enjoying a very cushy string of softball, low-value interviews from blue dog media types for far too long.

Former Republican Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney suggested on ""CBS Mornings"" on Thursday that she won't mount a third-party presidential run if it helps former President Donald Trump in the 2024 race for the White House.

""I won't do anything that would help him,"" she said, when asked about possibly running as a third-party candidate.

Cheney told news publications this week she was weighing a presidential run and would do ""whatever it takes"" to block Trump from returning to office.

"Liz Cheney suggests she won't run for president if it helps Donald Trump, says she'll back ""pro-Constitution"" candidates ""no matter their party""","I feel like there couldn't be even a single Republican voter that would vote for her and really what she'd end up doing is taking in some independents which actually would be beneficial, but I dunno I think Trump's biggest chance in losing the election lies in him being found guilty in any one of his criminal trials. 

Basically **that** is going to straight up nuke any independent support he could have had. Yeah his Republican voters think every criminal charge for any of them (their voters and leaders alike) are like badges of honor because to them it shows ""they were steadfast when standing up to ""the system"""", but they also believe that, inherently, the system itself is rigged against them and *only* them, thus resulting in a constant victim complex developed throughout the process of what it means to be a Republican voter. 

Independents by and large are not going to willingly vote for anyone who is actually **convicted** of putting real actions towards *fraudulently* ***acting on*** *a goal to install Trump as President artificially and illicitly. The single most anti-democracy thing a person could possibly do.* 

His nutty base isn't enough to clinch it for him. All the Republicans who are thinking ""shit man I'm no Democrat but we literally cannot have nor afford Trump getting in as President a second time"" really should just be supporting Biden. He's the incumbent President and it's quite rare, overall, for a President to only get the 1 term. Trump did, but he also sucked ass and couldn't pull off his illegal ""win"" even **with** the power of the Presidency (which he still was when he committed all these crimes) as well as the gargantuan right-wing media machine. People point out a lot that Trump **gained** numbers between 2016 and 2020, but what they never say as well is that.....yeah Trump got a lot more votes which is pretty fuckin shitty, but Biden **eclipsed** it with the popular vote win and the EC by 70 EC votes. 

Sure his numbers went up, but as they did, an even steeper incline of people who detest him, specifically, also rose up and seemed to become a bigger number than his increases.",0.96

What happened to conditioning federal money on states loosening up their zoning? That seemed like a reasonable idea.

btw, note that virtually all of those quotes aren’t about hedge fund ownership in particular. Also, when they do mention corporate ownership it’s about private equity - are those the same thing?

I don't.

If I were president, or a Democrat in leadership, I would be taking this very seriously.

I would immediately get on TV, and on every social media outlet, I would be making plans, I would be announcing changes, I would be leveraging every bit of power I had right away to escalate investigations, to try to get laws passed, and to sound every alarm possible on every outlet I could, because this is literally the end of democracy.

Trump said he would throw his political enemies in jail and I would take that seriously.

But I look at the Democrats in power right now, and how nonchalant they are, and how they're not really doing anything, not even making a TikTok or Facebook posts.

I just can't take them seriously.

Their whole strategy seems to be to wish upon a magic star that the voters vote blue. That's it. Just wish and hope.

I think that's a failed strategy. I really think the Democrats in power should be taking a lot more action right away.

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Evangelical Christrians want a holy war.  They want the Jews to wipe out the Muslims so then the Jews will rebuild Solomon's temple.  When that happens, these Christro-fascists believe Jesus will return and wipe out the unbelieving Jews.  

Its a means to an end.  They don't actually like Jews.  They just need them for the time being to bring on the end times.",0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,Because we already gave our suggestion to NOT use the weapon that we sent.,0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Cynical Israeli politicians, like hard-right asshole Bibi Netanyahu, learned a long time ago that by playing the holocaust card and tossing around accusations of antisemitism they could get anything that they wanted.

And I say this as a man who is old enough to have had holocaust survivors as language teachers in my mostly Jewish classrooms.  One was a German Jew who had served as a translator at the Neurenberg trials.  And the other was a Polish woman who had been interned at Auschwitz as a seventeen-year-old girl.

Both were incredibly empathetic and charitable humans and, in that regard, entirely unlike Netanyahu.",0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Because if we don't, the rest of the mid-east will interpret that as US abandons Israel and Israel will get wiped off the map in no short order.  US also funds Palestine, one of the first actions Biden took was to reverse Trump's block of aid to Palestine, so ultimately it's better the US is involved in both, and that we can leverage some sort of control (even if it's just to get temporary pauses to exchange hostages) over Netanyahu until the people of Israel replace him themselves.",0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,It’s really quite simple and separate from debate. Israel was reconstituted following the horrors of WWII. It’s been known that Israel’s continued existence is totally dependent on the neighboring countries being completely unable to reclaim the land. Here we are 70 years later and no real progress has been made with regard to true coexistence in the region. It no longer matters who’s doing it or why. The region seems ready to implode.,0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Because we've all decided somehow that it's tied to our national identity, and the people who like to think of themselves as kingmakers set that along with support for the 2nd amendment as their dealbreakers.

Maybe it's time to get dirty money out of politics. Again.",0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Israel is a western aligned democracy and US ally that enjoys strong political support across the political spectrum.

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Got to love the prevailing idea here on reddit: That the USA should abandon it's ally, in favor of...<checks notes> Hamas, who is a terrorist organization that murders, rapes and tortures. They also have vowed to continue murdering, raping, and torturing, until they can commit genocide in Israel. And, to a lesser extent...<checks notes> the PLO, who pay the families of terrorists and murderers, to encourage people to kill Israelis.   


Yeah. Abandoning Israel, and potentially causing the Middle East to lose its only democracy, so that a country hostile to US interests and which is in the orbit of Iran, can take its place...that is what the USA should be doing. Riiiiiight.",0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"To be clear because this is a bullshit headline, the US has not been sending endless supplies of arms to Israel since the war started. New aid has not even been approved to them yet and Biden has even said he’s willing to consider conditions on new aid.

Also, Israel has one of the most advanced weapons manufacturing industries on the planet. They create 40% of the world’s drones and are responsible for 10% of weapon exports worldwide. They have developed their own fighter jets, missiles, arms, nuclear weapons, and defense systems. Their ability to cause harm if they wish is not dependent on US aid or sales. If you take it away from them, they can still inflict damage. Only now you have absolutely no say in the war efforts, whereas now we can still influence them as needed because they want those weapons and they want US protection from Iran. Geopolitics are more complicated than just “stop sending them shit and then they can’t do anything.” That is an elementary understanding of how and why certain things are done the way they are.",0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"The same reason we support Israel in the first place.  Religous nutjobs with doomsday fetishes believe nonsensical fairy tales that involve Israel.  They want a character from that fairy tale to ""return"" despite never existing.  There's no other reason.  They act like there's a strategic reason for this support sometimes, but that's just a post-hoc justification given to deflect from their actual reason.",0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,because it's protecting the only democracy in the middle east - and the only country in that region that faces international questions about its legitimacy and right to exist in a region that is full of countries whose existences came about in similar fashion to Israel's,0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,The answer is likely Christianity,0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"AIPAC and, ultimately, how closely we've tied ourselves to Israel over the last seven decades. Enough said.",0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,Because the US is actually a force of evil masquerading as the hero. Literally the Homelander of countries. We smile and wave while we drop nukes and overthrow democracies around the world. I’m voting blue in November but I am NOT happy with Biden over this bullshit.,0.8
Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,Good question.  Write your representatives and ask.,0.8

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,Bc we must show fealty to Jesus land. To criticize the government of Israel is to be called an anti semite. No government should ever be above criticism.,0.8

People don’t seem to recognize how many more people would die if Israel is attacked by the hostile or semi hostile countries surrounding it. 

Israel is dealing with their situation and sending them supplies and money is preventing a far bloodier and destructive conflict.

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,"Mmmm… maybe because if you have to say a or b, Israel (mostly) stands for what is objectively right/just and Hamas/Palestine stands for what is objectively wrong/evil!

Why is the US still sending an endless supply of arms to Israel without conditions?,There's some level of desperation I feel. I read the oil and gas fields near Gaza that when developed are worth trillions and complete a major trade route we've been cajoling for years with various geopolitical chess moves. China has ever  increasing influence in the region economically and if we didn't have the military beach head in Israel we could lose all influence in the region. Someone somewhere thinks that the destabilizing effect of losing the region is a more severe risk than the destabilizing effect of greenlighting a genocide and losing moral credibility. The mad rush to secure the last remaining petrochemical resources must be a higher priority than the public realizes. I can't rationalize it any other way. It's madness.,0.8

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is \[Your Name\], and I am a concerned resident of \[Your City/State\]. I am writing to you today to express my strong support for a crucial piece of legislation introduced by Senator Jeff Merkley from Oregon.

The bill is titled ""S.3402 - A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose an excise tax on the failure of certain hedge funds owning excess single-family residences to dispose of such residences, and for other purposes."" I believe this legislation is vital for addressing issues related to housing affordability and promoting responsible ownership in our community.

As a resident of your district, I am acutely aware of the challenges many individuals and families face in securing affordable housing. Senator Merkley's proposed bill represents a significant step toward addressing these concerns by holding hedge funds accountable for their role in the housing market.

I kindly urge you to support and advocate for the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives. By doing so, you will contribute to fostering a fair and equitable housing market, ensuring that our community members have access to the affordable housing they deserve.

Thank you for your time and dedication to representing the interests of our community. I trust that you will carefully consider this request and take a stand in favor of the much-needed reforms outlined in Senator Merkley's bill.

Sincerely,

\[Your Full Name\]",0.98

“Policies really need to be shaped and crafted so that they support the production, investment and development of new housing,” Mr. Howard said. “I think bills that work against that ultimately are just going to perpetuate the challenges we’re already facing.” ""

Pay Attention to that. That's the self serving argument the Republicans will use to kill this and keep home prices up despite a cooling market. They will fight this one hard. It's way too easy to own rental property. They will have multiple members who own such.",0.98
New Legislation Proposes to Take Wall Street Out of the Housing Market,"WTF is this bill really doing?

""A Bill: To prohibit individuals and entities from owning more than 100 single-family residences, and for other purposes.""

Page 2: 'Taxpayers' are exempt from a $20,000 tax on homes over 100, if they sell 10% of the homes they own by the end of the year. 

Does this not mean they can own 10,000 homes, and if they flip 1000 by the end of the year, they don't pay the $20K tax, can buy another 10,000 at the beginning of the next, and then sell 1900 by the end of the next year, and avoid the tax again, and repeat ad infinitum? 

**Exclusions, page 3:** 

**‘‘(A) a mortgage note holder that owns a single-family residence through foreclosure ,**  
‘‘(B) a organization which is described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a),  
**‘‘(C) any person primarily engaged in the construction or rehabilitation of single-family residences, or**  
**‘‘(D) any person who owns federally subsidized housing.**

**Reporting, pg. 6, $20K penalty, but:**

**14 penalty** shall be imposed under this paragraph  
15 with respect to any failure **if it is shown that**  
**16 such failure is due to reasonable cause** and not  
17 to willful neglect.

Hedge funders and their lawyers can come up with all kinds of 'reasonable cause' that their paid-for pols and captured regulators will buy, I'm sure.

New Legislation Proposes to Take Wall Street Out of the Housing Market,"Briefly, I worked for an investment company as a project manager for their software portfolio. This included a tool for inspectors to review properties after purchase to determine the cost of repairs rapidly. This was due to their buying huge swaths of homes, sight unseen, with the expectation that work would be needed or they would be torn down. One inspector I worked with to test the software had been assigned a batch of thirty houses in the same mid-sized neighborhood. The bulk of the neighborhood had become rental properties or kept vacant by the company.  


It really gave me some horrible insight into how much of the available housing is snapped up by investors and investment groups like them, with no interest in anything but recouping the cost at minimum or making a huge cashout when they re-sold the property. They are mostly responsible for prices skyrocketing everywhere and it happens even in smaller cities now.",0.98

>When Trump engages in the conspiracy-theory politics of destroying “the deep state”, what he really means is that he will rule by presidential decree and where possible undermine independent federal institutions, thus destroying the checks and balances that have for two and a half centuries been at the heart of the American constitution. No longer would we be able to say that the rule of law and democracy prevails in America, ***that voting is free of interference or intimidation***, or that power is properly accountable. He would kill for good any ideal of the “city on the hill”, and the liberal rules-based order with the US as the model for the world to emulate.

>Trump has already given us a preview of what awaits in this term, or what he calls his “final battle” for an “independent America”. This time around, Extreme-right thinktanks such as the Heritage Foundation are giving him detailed policy playbooks, like one titled ***Project 2025***, which recommends radically reshaping government departments and consolidating power in the executive branch, that he could implement from day one.

Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,">  “The state says that Ms Cox has no injury, the harms to her health are not imminent but are ‘purely hypothetical’ and her legal claims are not yet ripe. These arguments are frankly stunning. The state goes as far to characterize her claims as ‘a frivolous assertion of harm’,” she said. Duane said the state’s argument amounted to a patient having to be about to die before they can have an abortion.

>   Jonathan Stone, the lawyer representing Texas, said: “The only party that’s going to suffer an immediate and irreparable harm in this case if the court enters a [temporary restraining order] is the state.” He claimed this was because Texas would not get to make its legal arguments in a regular hearing.

They tried to say the state of Texas is the victim here!  I am disgusted but not surprised.",0.98
Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,">Duane said in a statement after the hearing: “Today’s decision underscores what we already know – abortion is essential healthcare. While we are grateful that Kate will be able to get this urgent medical care, it is unforgivable that she was forced to go to court to ask for it in the middle of a medical emergency.

>“Most women are not able to do what Kate has done – many Texans have been forced to continue pregnancies that put their lives at risk. That is happening every day across Texas. As long as abortion is banned, pregnant people will suffer. As we await the Texas supreme court’s ruling in Zurawski v State of Texas, our hearts go out to the countless people in similar situations who – for so many reasons – aren’t able to sue the state of Texas for an emergency hearing.”

Texas judge rules woman with non-viable pregnancy can have an abortion,"Fuck Texas. Fuck the idiots who voted for this horror show.   


I went through this hell. A completely non viable pregnancy where five different doctors told me there was no chance and yet every damned one of them told me to wait around for the inevitable miscarriage. Because that was less traumatic for THEM than terminating a non viable pregnancy. Because they didn’t want to be the OBs who were known “for doing that”. 

They made me carry around a huge paper medical file everywhere I went, because I would surely miscarry at any time, and I was instructed to go to the nearest ER immediately when that started happening and give them the file. Because otherwise I might die or never be able to give birth again. 

And I was stupid and did what they said, living in agony every day over this and guess what? My body wasn’t doing what these doctors wanted it do to do absolve them of guilt.And I got mad. Furious. I demanded they treat the live patient in front of them rather than the malformed entity that was living off my body, would never be a child and might kill me, before it was too late.   


They said  “just go to planned parenthood. They do all the abortions in town.” I said “ You told me I needed to know if this was a congenital problem and learn if all my pregnancies would end up this way. Can they do genetic testing?” The answer was no, but they did not care. I got beyond furious. Frantic referrals, to another state and in DC, before we found a doctor who would help me.   


I was long married. This was a planned and wanted child. I went through unbelievable  trauma. I will always remain deeply grateful to the doctor who finally helped me. I went on to have two healthy children because of that doctor. They are both young adults.

I will never forget. Never. I was pro choice before. Don’t fuck with me now.  I marched in my first pro choice rally with my infant daughter on my back. I will  vote until the day I die for every woman to have the choice.",0.98

"Ron DeSantis' ""snake"" appearance during Republican debate goes viral","By Giulia Carbonaro

Ron DeSantis' tongue got a lot of attention on social media during the fourth Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, with users ridiculing the Florida governor for what they called his ""snake"" move.

DeSantis, who in Republican primary polling is at 12.7 percent of the vote, just a couple of percentage points ahead of former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has a habit of licking his lips during media appearances—something his critics have been quick to notice and mock.

U.S. Officials Privately Raise Fears Of Israel-Gaza Conflict Sparking A Broader War,">Despite repeated calls for Israeli restraint from senior figures in the Biden administration, U.S. intelligence assesses the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are committed to “business as usual,” with only limited concern about civilian casualties, a U.S. official said, and there are suspicions the renewed campaign is actually bloodier than the previous offensive in northern Gaza.

What do the ""calls of restraint"" from the Biden administration accomplish as long as they [keep providing Israel with weapons to bomb Palestinians?](https://theintercept.com/2023/11/25/biden-israel-weapons-stockpile-arms-gaza/)

>A third State Department official voiced frustration with recent news articles suggesting the U.S. is encouraging Israeli caution and similar public statements, arguing: “It just feels like patting ourselves on the back while it increasingly seems like the IDF are waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing.”

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors.

The US Condemned Stalin’s Prosecution of Journalists. Now It Uses His Playbook—The prosecution of Julian Assange in 2023 mirrors the prosecution of journalist Bill Oatis during the Cold War.,"Assange is a Russian asset and lie peddler, a Russian tool through and through. Illegal access to classified documents is a crime, and using them and twisting them to help Russia and attempt to harm the USA is a crime. One many GOP try to cover up even to this day, and are fighting in courts as they, too, are at risk of prosecution.

NEVER FORGET: Wikileaks is based in Russia, with the help of Russia, at the direction of Russia when deciding what to ""leak"" and only ever benefits Russia.

Assange is a republican in all but name. He breaks major laws and when a criminal charge is brought up to prosecute him, it's everybody else in the world's fault, he's an innocent angel, and he doubles and triples down on claiming it's all politically motivated false accusations (when we have the actual laws, and the facts, to show yes, he intentionally broke the law). Meanwhile he was literally hiding from Sweden when they acceused him of 3 counts of sexual assault in an embassy in Ecuador for 3+years. Very GOP-like, I'd say. The whole BS claim that Sweden made up those just to get him so they can extradite him to the US? Hell, Sweden isn't that good a friend of the US. They're still hiding BILLIONS of dollars of tax cheats and still holding on to probably Trillions in missing Nazi gold. Sweden is NOT a close enough friend to pull that BS for us. More ""look, look!!

On the other hand, I think that the Espionage Act charges against Assange for receiving and publishing classified information are extremely bad and unconstitutional. I would drop the Espionage charges against Assange while keeping the conspiracy to hack charge.",0.3

Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,These articles *are* a joke. He's made it clear several times he has no interest in running for president.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"TL;DR - It's a joke. Or, at least, a pointless hypothetical by an out of touch moron (the author, not Stewart) who ignores that Stewart has enthusiastically refused to seek political office and anyone who had ever watched or listened to him would know that.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Yes, yes it is. 

I think the world of Jon Stewart, but if someone hasn't started building a campaign infrastructure by now, they're not going to be able to spin one up and mount a serious challenge to Trump in 11 months. Biden is going to be the nominee. He's the only serious Democratic candidate.

Plus, and this may be crazy talk, but the person with the best chance to beat Trump is probably the guy who last beat Trump.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"It's too late! 

Ballot access in Nevada closed in October, there's about another dozen states that closed ballot access since then, and another dozen that close in the next week. 

The whole Biden alternative thing needs to stop. The time for that campaign was 6 months ago, not in the eve of mathematical impossibility.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,How about no more TV presidents ever?,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"It's not (or shouldn't be) an entry level job. If celebrities want to go into politics, start at the bottom.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,I don't know. What's his stance on tan suits?,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Unfortunately, SERIOUS government is dry and boring.  Biden is a doing a great job, and hardly anyone knows it, because it would put them to sleep. 

I think that's one of the biggest flaws of our democracy.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Just cause the author doesn't think this is a joke, doesn't mean it isn't.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Jon Stewart is great, but I prefer someone with experience governing.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"**Ranked Choice Voting.** or Instant Run-Off voting.

The only thing that's a joke here is that we're having semi-serious arguments about what **one single candidate** progressives should get behind.

No. Change the ridiculous voting system so that I can vote for Jon Stewart, but if he doesn't get enough votes then my vote instantly transfers to Elizabeth Warren, and if she doesn't get enough votes, then sure, Biden.

This is the conversation we need to be having. I can't respect an article like the one above if it doesn't even *mention* the fact that our current voting system is unnecessarily driving us into these fake quandries.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,Watching to see how many commenters here will unironically think this is a good idea,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,No 😐,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Jon Stewart absolutely has a place in politics, but not as President. I'd love to see him in the Senate speaking truth to power there and being a vocal moral compass.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,Gavin Newsome with John Stewart as V.P.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,The intercept is a joke.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"I think what is more important about Jon Stewart is how Apple decided to prevent him from being critical (honest) about China. And thus, Jon left Apple and his show. Tim Cook really is a Communist, putting democracy behind profits.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,It's a joke to those of us who know what's at stake.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,No,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,Media is so desperate for clicks right now. Yawn.,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,The Intercept likes the fact that he is pro-Palestine,0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,">Cohen acknowledges that this idea is “a Hail Mary,” but “these are desperate times,” given that we are currently on track for a second Trump presidency.

>That concept is horrifying, given that it could plausibly mean the collapse of U.S. democracy. The paradox of our current plight is that the people screeching most loudly — the corporate Democratic establishment — have demonstrated by their immovable support for Biden that they do not actually take this threat seriously. As Cohen puts it, they’d “rather lose with Biden, someone they can control and someone they’ve known and used for 30 years, than win with someone they can’t.” 

Took awhile to get there but the article did go there. 

If someone like Stewart ran it would be after Biden or if something came up in the next 11 months. The Democrat Party will not allow another Democrat to win after they have already chosen someone.",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Yes it is!

I love JS, but please . . .",0.39
Jon Stewart for Celebrity President. This Is Not a Joke!,"Fine, make him president of celebrities.",0.39

Van Jones 'shaking' over Ramaswamy remarks: 'That guy is dangerous',Ramaswamy is the most blatantly pandering politician I’ve ever seen. I genuinely don’t think he even believes 90% of what’s coming out of his mouth. He just saw how stupid the Republican base is and figured he could exploit it by saying what they want to hear. But he’s the wrong color for that crowd and they’re loyal to only Trump.,0.81

Republicans Plan Vote To Formally Authorize Impeachment Inquiry Against Joe Biden,">Johnson has stressed the difference between an authorization vote and an actual impeachment vote against the president.

>“This vote is not a vote to impeach President Biden,” Johnson said at a press conference this week. “This is a vote to continue the inquiry of impeachment. It’s a necessary constitutional step.”

Okay Mike but when you ram this through on a party-line vote the headline on Fox is still definitely going to be ""Biden impeachment vote passes!"" and I know that's all that counts to you.",0.72

They even have the cheques! It's indisputable that he lent relatives money. And to top it off, he was a private citizen at the time which makes it ...... even worse? Clearly America has a criminal mastermind as President. A dementia riddled criminal mastermind who lends people money.

Republicans Plan Vote To Formally Authorize Impeachment Inquiry Against Joe Biden,"The days are numbered for the GOP. We need to re-elect Biden so a more progressive Dem can get the nomination in 2028. By then millennials and Gen Z will make up the majority of the electorate and most boomers will have croaked.

Their backwards ideas aren't popular with these young people and the sooner we can just leave the Republican Party to the shame of history the better.The future is coming and everyone here needs to get on board or get left behind.

Thanks to the aid of our millennial and Gen Z brothers and sisters, Republicans will soon be extinct. Therefore we can have total Democratic control and abolish all national borders, abolish homeschooling, set diversity requirements for Presidential tickets, codify LGBTQIA+ hate speech protection into the 1st amendment, and raise taxes on white middle class suburbians to successfully pay reparations to all black American citizens.

These old white men controlling everything are terrified of being replaced by a progressive, minority white group of young free thinkers who will right every wrong in this flawed country and create a more stable loving nation that prioritizes love, science, and equality.",0.72

"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say",LOL. This was so obvious.,0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","Do what Australia does.   Tax the shit out of them and use the collected money on campaigns to reduce smoking rates and cancer services/research. 

People keep their freedom but they contribute to a pool of money to address smoking problems.",0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","What I think is [some relevant statistics about smoking and demographics](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm#nation)

Key takeaways are that 11.5% of all US adults are smokers and 11.7% of black US adults are smokers so using this article’s claim of 80%+ of black smokers smoke menthols you’re looking at 9.5%-ish of black adults. 

Some other interesting info imo:the lower the household income, the higher the rate of smoking was (maxing out at 18.3%) and the Midwest was the area where people smoked the most at 14% followed by the South at 12.4%, Northeast at 10.4% and out west 8.9%. The interactive map towards the bottom of the page has some interesting information on each state as well. Unfortunately, no data on urban vs suburban vs rural.",0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","Honestly, a good chunk of laws around tobacco/nicotine are bs.  


It’s a bad habit, and everyone knows that, stop making up rules about how people are allowed to enjoy their bad habits unless you’re going to apply them equally to all products that are bad for you. 

We can’t have flavored vapes/cigarettes because it’s “marketed to kids”, but alcohol companies are allowed to sell any flavor of beverage they want, and dispensaries are allowed to sell edibles that are literally candy?

All three products are illegall to sell to anyone under 21 where I live. If kids are getting them it’s not a marketing problem, it’s a people selling things to kids problem.",0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say",How about they just stop prohibition on drugs? It doesn't work. If you want less people to smoke then invest in programs to convince people not to smoke. Making it illegal is anti democratic imo.,0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","I mean, this was obviously a bad idea, right?

Democrats want to decrease the negative effects of over-policing on Black communities.

But then they passed a bill that would **increase** the criminalization and policing of Black communities. Never made an ounce of sense.",0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","Banning cigarettes of any kind is pretty stupid. Yeah, they're unhealthy. Lots of things are.",0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say",Good. As a non-smoker I think it's so unsavory when the government tells us what we can and can't do with our bodies.,0.79
"Biden admin to delay menthol cigarettes ban following backlash from Black community, reports say","Prohibition has failed every time it has been tried. Every. Time.  

The jury has been back on smoking for a long time, it’s bad, everyone knows this.  But if adults want to smoke that’s their decision.  

Same with vaping, if an adult wants a grape-flavored nicotine vape that’s their decision.  Leave them alone.",0.79
